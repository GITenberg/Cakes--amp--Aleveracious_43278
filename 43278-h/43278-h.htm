<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>
<p>A long time ago, an estimable lady fell at the
    feet of an habitual publisher, and prayed unto
    him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give, oh! give me the subject of a book for
    which the world has a need, and I will write it
    for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you an author, madam?&rdquo; asked the
    publisher, motioning his visitor to a seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; was the proud reply, &ldquo;I am a poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the great man. &ldquo;I am afraid
    there is no immediate worldly need of a poet. If
    you could only write a good cookery book, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story goes on to relate how the poetess,
    not rebuffed in the least, started on the requisite
    culinary work, directly she got home; pawned
    her jewels to purchase postage stamps, and wrote
    far and wide for recipes, which in course of time
    she obtained, by the hundredweight. Other
    recipes she &ldquo;conveyed&rdquo; from ancient works of
    gastronomy, and in a year or two the <i>magnum opus</i> was given to the world; the lady&rsquo;s share in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> profits giving her &ldquo;adequate provision for the
    remainder of her life.&rdquo; We are not told, but it
    is presumable, that the publisher received a little
    adequate provision too.</p>
<p>History occasionally repeats itself; and the
    history of the present work begins in very much
    the same way. Whether it will finish in an
    equally satisfactory manner is problematical. I do
    not possess much of the divine <i>afflatus</i> myself;
    but there has ever lurked within me some sort
    of ambition to write a book&mdash;something held
    together by &ldquo;tree calf,&rdquo; &ldquo;half morocco,&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;boards&rdquo;; something that might find its way
    into the hearts and homes of an enlightened
    public; something which will give some of my
    young friends ample opportunity for criticism.
    In the exercise of my profession I have written
    leagues of descriptive &ldquo;copy&rdquo;&mdash;mostly lies and
    racing selections,&mdash;but up to now there has been
    no urgent demand for a book of any sort from
    this pen. For years my ambition has remained
    ungratified. Publishers&mdash;as a rule, the most faint-hearted
    and least speculative of mankind&mdash;have
    held aloof. And whatever suggestions I might
    make were rejected, with determination, if not
    with contumely.</p>
<p>At length came the hour, and the man; the
    introduction to a publisher with an eye for
    budding and hitherto misdirected talent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you care, sir,&rdquo; I inquired at the outset,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> &ldquo;to undertake the dissemination of a bulky work
    on Political Economy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, sir, I do not,&rdquo; was the reply.
    Then I tried him with various subjects&mdash;social
    reform, the drama, bimetallism, the ethics of
    starting prices, the advantages of motor cars in
    African warfare, natural history, the martyrdom
    of Ananias, practical horticulture, military law,
    and dogs; until he took down an old duck-gun
    from a peg over the mantelpiece, and assumed a
    threatening attitude.</p>
<p>Peace having been restored, the self-repetition
    of history recommenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do with a good, bold, brilliant, lightly
    treated, exhaustive work on Gastronomy,&rdquo; said
    the publisher, &ldquo;you are well acquainted with the
    subject, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit of a parlour cook, if that&rsquo;s what
    you mean,&rdquo; was my humble reply. &ldquo;At a salad,
    a grill, an anchovy toast, or a cooling and cunningly
    compounded cup, I can be underwritten
    at ordinary rates. But I could no more cook a
    haunch of venison, or even boil a rabbit, or make
    an economical Christmas pudding, than I could
    sail a boat in a nor&rsquo;-easter; and Madam Cook
    would certainly eject me from her kitchen, with
    a clout attached to the hem of my dinner jacket,
    inside five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually it was decided that I should commence
    this book.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What I want,&rdquo; said the publisher, &ldquo;is a
    series of essays on food, a few anecdotes of stirring
    adventure&mdash;you have a fine flow of imagination,
    I understand&mdash;and a few useful, but uncommon
    recipes. But plenty of plums in the book, my
    dear sir, plenty of plums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, suppose my own supply of plums should
    not hold out, what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do&mdash;what does the cook do,
    when the plums for her pudding run short? Get
    some more; the Museum, my dear sir, the great
    storehouse of national literature, is free to all
    whose character is above the normal standard.
    When your memory and imagination fail, try the
    British Museum. You know what is a mightier
    factor than both sword and pen? Precisely so.
    And remember that in replenishing your store
    from the works of those who have gone before,
    you are only following in their footsteps. I only
    bar Sydney Smith and Charles Lamb. Let me
    have the script by Christmas&mdash;d&rsquo;you smoke?&mdash;mind
    the step&mdash;<i>good</i> morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way, gentle reader, were the trenches
    dug, the saps laid for the attack of the great work.
    The bulk of it is original, and the adventures in
    which the writer has taken part are absolutely
    true. About some of the others I would not be
    so positive. Some of the recipes have previously
    figured in the pages of the <i>Sporting Times</i>, the <i>Lady&rsquo;s Pictorial</i>, and the <i>Man of the World</i>, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> the proprietors of which journals I hereby express
    my kindly thanks for permission to revive them.
    Many of the recipes are original; some are my
    own; others have been sent in by relatives, and
    friends of my youth; others have been adapted
    for modern requirements from works of great
    antiquity; whilst others again&mdash;I am nothing if
    not candid&mdash;have been &ldquo;conveyed&rdquo; from the
    works of more modern writers, who in their turn
    had borrowed them from the works of their
    ancestors. There is nothing new under the sun;
    and there are but few absolute novelties which
    are subjected to the heat of the kitchen fire.</p>
<p>If the style of the work be faulty, the reason&mdash;not
    the excuse&mdash;is that the style is innate, and
    not modelled upon anybody else&rsquo;s style. The
    language I have endeavoured to make as plain,
    homely, and vigorous as is the food advocated. If
    the criticisms on foreign cookery should offend
    the talented <i>chef</i>, I have the satisfaction of knowing
    that, as I have forsworn his works, he will
    be unable to retaliate with poison. And if the
    criticisms on the modern English methods of
    preparing food should attract the attention of the
    home caterer, he may possibly be induced to give
    his steam-chest and his gas-range a rest, and put
    the roast beef of Old England on his table,
    occasionally; though I have only the very faintest
    hopes that he will do so. For the monster eating-houses
    and mammoth hotels of to-day are for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> most part &ldquo;run&rdquo; by companies and syndicates;
    and the company within the dining-room suffer
    occasionally, in order that dividends may be
    possible after payment has been made for the
    elaborate, and wholly unnecessary, furniture, and
    decorations. Wholesome food is usually sufficient
    for the ordinary British appetite, without such
    surroundings as marble pillars, Etruscan vases,
    nude figures, gilding, and looking-glasses, which
    only serve to distract attention from the banquet.
    It is with many a sigh that I recall the good old-fashioned
    inn, where the guest really received a
    warm welcome. Nowadays, the warmest part of
    that welcome is usually the bill.</p>
<p>It is related of the wittiest man of the nineteenth
    century, my late friend Mr. Henry J.
    Byron, that, upon one occasion, whilst walking
    home with a brother dramatist, after the first
    performance of his comedy, which had failed to
    please the audience, Byron shed tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; inquired his friend. &ldquo;The
    failure of my play appears to affect you strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only weeping,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;because
    I was afraid you&rsquo;d set to work, and write another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there need be no tears shed on any page
    of this food book. For I am not going to
    &ldquo;write another.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
    <p>Formal or informal?&mdash;An eccentric old gentleman&mdash;The
        ancient Britons&mdash;Breakfast in the days of Good Queen
        Bess&mdash;A few tea statistics&mdash;&ldquo;Garraway&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;Something
        about coffee&mdash;Brandy for breakfast&mdash;The evolution of the
        staff of life&mdash;Free Trade&mdash;The cheap loaf, and no cash to
        buy it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very serious subject. The first meal
    of the day has exercised more influence over
    history than many people may be aware of. It
    is not easy to preserve an equal mind or keep a
    stiff upper lip upon an empty stomach; and indigestible
    food-stuffs have probably lost more
    battles than sore feet and bad ammunition. It
    is an incontestable fact that the great Napoleon
    lost the battles of Borodino and Leipsic through
    eating too fast.</p>
<p>When good digestion waits on appetite, great
    men are less liable to commit mistakes&mdash;and a
    mistake in a great man is a crime&mdash;than when
    dyspepsia has marked them for her own; and
    this rule applies to all men.</p>
<p>There should be no hurry or formality about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> breakfast. Your punctual host and hostess may
    be all very well from their own point of view;
    but black looks and sarcastic welcomings are an
    abomination to the guest who may have overslept
    himself or herself, and who fails to say, &ldquo;Good-morning&rdquo;
    just on the stroke of nine o&rsquo;clock.
    Far be it from the author&rsquo;s wish to decry the
    system of family prayers, although the spectacle
    of the full strength of the domestic company,
    from the stern-featured housekeeper, or the chief
    lady&rsquo;s-maid (the housekeeper is frequently too
    grand, or too much cumbered with other duties
    to attend public worship), to the diminutive page-boy,
    standing all in a row, facing the cups and
    saucers, is occasionally more provocative of mirth
    than reverence. But too much law and order
    about fast-breaking is to be deplored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very punctual, I&rsquo;m afraid, Sir John,&rdquo;
    I once heard a very charming lady observe to her
    host, as she took her seat at the table, exactly ten
    minutes after the line of menials had filed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Lady V&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; returned the
    master of the house, with a cast-iron smile, &ldquo;you
    are punctual in your unpunctuality; for you have
    missed prayers by the sixth part of one hour,
    every morning since you came.&rdquo; Now what
    should be done to a host like that?</p>
<p>In the long ago I was favoured with the
    acquaintance of an elderly gentleman of property,
    a most estimable, though eccentric, man. And
    he invariably breakfasted with his hat on. It did
    not matter if ladies were present or not. Down
    he would sit, opposite the ham and eggs&mdash;or
    whatever dish it might chance to be&mdash;with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> white hat, with mourning band attached, surmounting
    his fine head. We used to think the
    presence of the hat was owing to partial baldness;
    but, as he never wore it at luncheon or dinner,
    that idea was abandoned. In fact, he pleaded that
    the hat kept his thoughts in; and as after breakfast
    he was closeted with his steward, or agent,
    or stud-groom, or keeper, for several hours, he
    doubtless let loose some of those thoughts to one
    or the other. At all events we never saw him
    again till luncheon, unless there was any hunting
    or shooting to be done.</p>
<p>This same old gentleman once rehearsed his
    own funeral on the carriage drive outside, and
    stage-managed the solemn ceremony from his
    study window. An under-gardener pushed a
    wheelbarrow, containing a box of choice cuttings,
    to represent the body; and the butler posed as
    chief mourner. And when anybody went
    wrong, or the pall-bearers&mdash;six grooms&mdash;failed to
    keep in step, the master would throw up the
    window-sash, and roar&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this is wandering from the subject. Let
    us try back.</p>
<p>Having made wide search amongst old and
    musty manuscripts, I can find no record of a
    bill-of-fare of the first meal of the ancient
    Britons. Our blue forefathers, in all probability,
    but seldom assisted at any such smart function as
    a wedding-breakfast, or even a hunting one;
    for the simple reason that it was a case with
    them of, &ldquo;no hunt, no breakfast.&rdquo; Unless one
    or other had killed the deer, or the wild-boar, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> some other living thing to furnish the refection
    the feast was a Barmecide one, and much as we
    have heard of the strength and hardiness of our
    blue forefathers, many of them must have died of
    sheer starvation. For they had no weapons but
    clubs, and rough cut flints, with which to kill
    the beasts of the country&mdash;who were, however,
    occasionally lured into pitfalls; and as to fish,
    unless they &ldquo;tickled&rdquo; them, the denizens of the
    streams must have had an easy time of it. They
    had sheep, but these were valuable chiefly on
    account of their wool; as used to be the case in
    Australia, ere the tinned meat trade was established.
    Most of the fruits and vegetables which
    we enjoy to-day were introduced into Britain
    by the Romans. Snipe and woodcock and (in
    the north) grouse may have been bagged, as well
    as hares. But these poor savages knew not
    rabbits by sight, nor indeed, much of the feathered
    fowl which their more favoured descendants are
    in the habit of shooting, or otherwise destroying,
    for food. The ancient Britons knew not bacon
    and eggs, nor the toothsome kipper, nor yet the
    marmalade of Dundee. As for bread, it was not
    invented in any shape or form until much later;
    and its primitive state was a tough paste of flour,
    water, and (occasionally) milk&mdash;something like
    the &ldquo;damper&rdquo; of the Australian bush, or the
    unleavened <i>chupati</i> which the poorer classes in
    Hindustan put up with, after baking it, at the
    present day.</p>
<p>The hardy, independent Saxon, had a much
    better time of it, in the way of meat and drink.
    But with supper forming the chief meal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> day, his breakfast was a simple, though plentiful
    one, and consisted chiefly of venison pasty and
    the flesh of goats, washed down with ale, or
    mead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A free breakfast-table of Elizabeth&rsquo;s time,&rdquo;
    says an old authority, &ldquo;or even during the more
    recent reign of Charles II., would contrast oddly
    with our modern morning meal. There were
    meats, hot and cold; beef and brawn, and boar&rsquo;s
    head, the venison pasty, and the</p>
<h4><i>Wardon Pie</i></h4>
<p>of west country pears. There was hot bread,
    too, and sundry &lsquo;cates&rsquo; which would now be
    strange to our eyes. But to wash down these
    substantial viands there was little save ale. The
    most delicate lady could procure no more suitable
    beverage than the blood of John Barleycorn.
    The most fretful invalid had to be content
    with a mug of small beer, stirred up with a sprig
    of rosemary. Wine, hippocras, and metheglin
    were potations for supper-time, not for breakfast,
    and beer reigned supreme. None but home productions
    figured on the board of our ancestors.
    Not for them were seas traversed, or tropical
    shores visited, as for us. Yemen and Ceylon,
    Assam and Cathay, Cuba and Peru, did not send
    daily tribute to their tables, and the very names
    of tea and coffee, of cocoa and chocolate, were
    to them unknown. The dethronement of ale,
    subsequent on the introduction of these eastern
    products, is one of the most marked events which
    have severed the social life of the present day from
    that of the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>With the exception of the Wardon pie and
    the &ldquo;cates,&rdquo; the above bill-of-fare would probably
    satisfy the cravings of the ordinary &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo; of
    to-day, who has heard the chimes at midnight,
    and would sooner face a charging tiger than
    drink tea or coffee with his first meal, which,
    alas! but too often consists of a hot-pickle
    sandwich and a &ldquo;brandy and soda,&rdquo; with not
    quite all the soda in. But just imagine the fine
    lady of to-day with a large tankard of Burton
    ale facing her at the breakfast-table.</p>
<h4><i>Tea</i>,</h4>
<p>which is said to have been introduced into China
    by Djarma, a native of India, about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 500,
    was not familiar in Europe until the end of the
    sixteenth century. And it was not until 1657,
    when Garraway opened a tea-house in Exchange
    Alley, that Londoners began tea-drinking as an
    experiment. In 1662 Pepys writes&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home, and there find my wife making of
    tea&rdquo;&mdash;two years before, he called it &ldquo;tee (a
    China drink)&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;a drink which Mr. Pelling the
    Pothicary tells her is good for her cold and
    defluxions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1740 the price of tea ranged from 7s. to
    24s. per lb. In 1725, 370,323 lbs. were drunk
    in England, and in 1890, 194,008,000. In
    1840 the duty was 2s. 2¼d. per lb.; in 1858
    1s. 5d. per lb.; and in 1890 4d. per lb.</p>
<p>The seed of</p>
<h4><i>The Coffee-Tree</i>,</h4>
<p>which, when roasted, ground, and mixed with
    water, and unmixed with horse-beans, dandelion-root,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> or road-scrapings, forms a most agreeable
    beverage to those who can digest it, was not
    known to the Greeks or Romans, but has been
    used in Abyssinia and along the north-east coast
    of Africa almost as long as those parts have been
    populated. Here, in merry England, where
    coffee was not introduced until the eighteenth
    century, it was at first used but sparingly, until
    it almost entirely took the place of chocolate,
    which was the favoured beverage of the duchesses
    and fine madams who minced and flirted, and
    plotted, during the reign of the Merry Monarch,
    fifty years or so before. The march of knowledge
    has taught the thrifty housewife of to-day
    to roast her own coffee, instead of purchasing it
    in that form from the retail shopkeeper, who, as
    a rule, under-roasts the berry, in order to &ldquo;keep
    the weight in.&rdquo; But do not blame him too
    freely, for he is occasionally a Poor Law Guardian,
    and has to &ldquo;keep pace with the Stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the Georgian era, the hard-drinking
    epoch, breakfast far too often consisted chiefly
    of French brandy; and the first meal was, in
    consequence, not altogether a happy or wholesome
    one, nor conducive to the close study of
    serious subjects.</p>
<p>The history of</p>
<h4><i>The Staff of Life</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h4>
<p>would require a much larger volume than this,
    all to itself. That the evolution of bread-making
    has been very gradual admits of no denial; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> as late as the Tudor and Stuart periods the art
    was still in its infancy. The quality of the
    bread consumed was a test of social standing.
    Thus, whilst the <i>haut monde</i>, the height of
    society, lords and dukes, with countesses and
    dames of high degree, were in the habit of
    consuming delicate manchets, made of the finest
    wheaten flour, of snowy purity, the middle classes
    had to content themselves with white loaves of
    inferior quality. To the journeyman and the
    &rsquo;prentice (who had to endure, with patience, the
    buffets of master and mistress) was meted out
    coarse but wholesome brown bread, made from
    an admixture of wheat and barley flour; whilst
    the agricultural labourer staved off starvation
    with loaves made from rye, occasionally mixed
    with red wheat or barley. The introduction of</p>
<h4><i>Free Trade</i></h4>
<p>&mdash;by no means an unmixed blessing&mdash;has changed
    all this; and the working-classes, with their wives
    and families, can, when out of the workhouse, in
    the intervals between &ldquo;strikes,&rdquo; enjoy the same
    quality of bread, that &ldquo;cheap loaf&rdquo; which appears
    on the table of the wicked squire and the all-devouring
    parson. In Yorkshire, at the present day,
    almost the worst thing that can be urged against
    a woman is that she &ldquo;canna mak&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look,&rdquo; wrote an enthusiastic Free Trader,
    a quarter of a century ago, &ldquo;at the immense change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> that has latterly taken place in the food of the
    English peasantry. Rye bread and pease-pudding
    exchanged for wheaten loaves. A startling
    change, but not greatly different from what has
    occurred in France, where, with the abuses of
    the Bourbon rule, an end was put to the semi-starvation
    of French tillers of the soil. Black
    bread is now almost as much a rarity in France
    as on our side of the Channel; while barley in
    Wales, oats in Scotland, and the potato in Ireland,
    are no longer the food-staples that they were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have no wish for anything of a contentious
    nature to appear in this volume; but may deliver,
    with regard to the above, the opinion that pease-pudding
    is by no means despicable fare, when
    associated with a boiled leg of pork; and I may
    add that too many of the English peasantry,
    nowadays, have been reduced, by this same Free
    Trade, to a diet of no bread at all, in place of
    wheaten, or any other loaves.</p>
<p>Wedding breakfasts, with the formal speeches,
    and cutting of the cake, have gone out of fashion,
    and the subject of the British breakfast of to-day
    demands a new chapter.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Country-house life&mdash;An Englishwoman at her best&mdash;Guests&rsquo;
        comforts&mdash;What to eat at the first meal&mdash;A few choice
        recipes&mdash;A noble grill-sauce&mdash;The poor outcast&mdash;Appetising

        rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By far the pleasantest meal of the day at a large
    country-house is breakfast. You will be staying
    there, most likely, an you be a man, for hunting
    or shooting&mdash;it being one of the eccentric dispensations
    of the great goddess Fashion that
    country-houses should be guestless, and often
    ownerless, during that season of the year when
    nature looks at her loveliest. An you be a
    woman, you will be staying there for the especial
    benefit of your daughter; for flirting&mdash;or for
    the more serious purpose of riveting the fetters
    of the fervid youth who may have been taken
    captive during the London season&mdash;for romping,
    and probably shooting and hunting, too; for lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> woman up-to-date takes but little account of such
    frivolities as Berlin wool-work, piano-practice,
    or drives, well wrapped-up, in a close carriage,
    to pay calls with her hostess. As for going out
    with the &ldquo;guns,&rdquo; or meeting the sterner sex at
    luncheon in the keeper&rsquo;s cottage, or the specially-erected
    pavilion, the darlings are not content,
    nowadays, unless they can use dapper little
    breech-loaders, specially made for them, and some
    of them are far from bad shots.</p>
<p>Yes, &rsquo;tis a pleasant function, breakfast at the
    Castle, the Park, or the Grange. But, as observed
    in the last chapter, there must be no undue
    punctuality, no black looks at late arrivals, no
    sarcastic allusions to late hours, nor inane chaff
    from the other guests about the wine cup or the
    whisky cup, which may have been drained in the
    smoking-room, during the small hours.</p>
<p>Her ladyship looks divine, or at all events
    regal, as she presides at what our American
    cousins would call the &ldquo;business end&rdquo; of the
    long table, whilst our host, a healthy, jolly-looking,
    &ldquo;hard-bitten&rdquo; man of fifty, faces her.
    His bright keen eye denotes the sportsman, and
    he can shoot as straight as ever, whilst no fence
    is too high, too wide, nor too deep for him.
    Sprinkled about, at either side of the table,
    amongst the red and black coats, or shooting
    jackets of varied hues&mdash;with a vacancy here and
    there, for &ldquo;Algie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Angel,&rdquo;
    who have not yet put in appearance&mdash;are
    smart, fresh-looking women, young, and &ldquo;well-preserved,&rdquo;
    and matronly, some in tailor-made
    frocks, and some in the silks and velvets suited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> for those of riper age, and some in exquisitely-fitting
    habits. It is at the breakfast-table that the
    Englishwoman can defy all foreign competition;
    and you are inclined to frown, or even say things
    under your breath, when that mincing, wicked-looking
    little <i>Marquise</i>, all frills, and ribbons,
    and lace, and smiles, and Ess Bouquet, in the
    latest creation of the first man-milliner of Paris,
    trips into the room in slippers two sizes too
    small for her, and salutes the company at large in
    broken English. For the contrast is somewhat
    trying, and you wonder why on earth some
    women <i>will</i> smother themselves with scents and <i>cosmetiques</i>, and raddle their cheeks and wear
    diamonds so early in the morning; and you lose
    all sense of the undoubted fascination of the
    Marquise in speculating as to what manner of
    &ldquo;strong woman&rdquo; her <i>femme de chambre</i> must be
    who can compress a 22-inch waist into an 18-inch
    corset.</p>
<p>There should, of course, be separate tea and
    coffee equipments for most of the guests&mdash;at all
    events for the sluggards. The massive silver
    urn certainly lends a tone to the breakfast-table,
    and looks &ldquo;comfortable-like.&rdquo; But it would be
    criminally cruel to satisfy the thirst of the multitude
    out of the same tea-pot or coffee-pot; and
    the sluggard will not love his hostess if she pours
    forth &ldquo;husband&rsquo;s tea,&rdquo; merely because he <i>is</i> a
    sluggard. And remember that the hand which
    has held two by honours, or a &ldquo;straight flush&rdquo;
    the night before, is occasionally too shaky to pass
    tea-cups. No. Do not spare your servants, my
    lord, or my lady. Your guests must be &ldquo;well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> done,&rdquo; or they will miss your &ldquo;rocketing&rdquo;
    pheasants, or fail to go fast enough at that brook
    with the rotten banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English,&rdquo; said an eminent alien, &ldquo;have
    only one sauce.&rdquo; This is a scandalous libel; but
    as it was said a long time ago it doesn&rsquo;t matter.
    It would be much truer to say that the English
    have only one breakfast-dish, and its name is</p>
<h4><i>Eggs and Bacon</i>.</h4>
<p>Pardon, I should have written two; and the
    second is ham and eggs. A new-laid egg&mdash;poached, <i>not</i> fried, an ye love me, O Betsy, best
    of cooks&mdash;and a rasher of home-cured hog are
    both excellent things in their way; but, like a
    partridge, a mother-in-law, and a baby, it is quite
    possible to have too much of them. The
    English hostess&mdash;I do not refer to the typical
    &ldquo;her ladyship,&rdquo; of whom I have written above,
    but to the average hostess&mdash;certainly launches
    out occasionally in the direction of assorted fish,
    kidneys, sausages, and chops, but the staple food
    upon which we are asked to break our fast is,
    undoubtedly, eggs and bacon.</p>
<p>The great question of what to eat at the first
    meal depends greatly upon whether you sit down
    to it directly you emerge from your bedroom, or
    whether you have indulged in any sort of exercise
    in the interim. After two or three hours
    &ldquo;amateur touting&rdquo; on such a place as Newmarket
    Heath, the sportsman is ready for any
    sort of food, from a dish of liver and bacon to a
    good, thick fat chop, or an underdone steak. I
    have even attacked cold stewed eels (!) upon an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> occasion when the pangs of hunger would have
    justified my eating the tom-cat, and the landlady
    as well. But chops and steaks are not to be
    commended to furnish forth the ordinary breakfast-table.
    I am coming to the hotel breakfast
    presently, so will say nothing about fried fish
    just yet. But here follows a list of a few of what
    may be called</p>
<h4><i>Allowable Breakfast Dishes</i></h4>
<p>Mushrooms (done plainly in front of the fire),
    sausages (toasted), scrambled eggs on toast,
    curried eggs, fish balls, kidneys, savoury omelette.
    Porridge may be useful for growing boys and
    briefless barristers, but this chapter is not written
    solely in their interests. Above all, do not, oh!
    do not, forget the grill, or broil. This should be
    the feature of the breakfast. Such simple recipes
    as those for the manufacture of fish balls or
    omelettes or curried eggs&mdash;though I shall have
    plenty to say about curries later on&mdash;need not be
    given here; but the following, for a grill-sauce,
    will be found invaluable, especially for the
    &ldquo;sluggard.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>Gubbins Sauce</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The legs and wings of fowl, turkey, pheasant,
        partridge, or moor-hen should only be used. Have
        these scored across with a sharp knife, and divided
        at the joints. And when your grill is taken, &ldquo;hot
        as hot,&rdquo; but <i>not burnt</i>, from the fire, have poured
        over it the following sauce. Be very particular
        that your cook pours it over the grill just before it
        is served up. And it is of the most vital importance
        that the sauce should be made, and well mixed, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> a plate <i>over hot water</i>&mdash;for instance, a slop-basin
        should be filled with boiling water and a plate
        placed atop.</p>
    <p>Melt on the plate a lump of butter the size of a
        large walnut. Stir into it, when melted, two teaspoonfuls
        of made mustard, then a dessert-spoonful
        of vinegar, half that quantity of tarragon vinegar,
        and a tablespoonful of cream&mdash;Devonshire or
        English. Season with salt, black pepper, and
        cayenne, according to the (presumed) tastes and
        requirements of the breakfasters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let your sideboard&mdash;it is assumed that you
    have a sideboard&mdash;sigh and lament its hard lot,
    under its load of cold joints, game, and pies,&mdash;I
    am still harping on the country-house; and
    if you have a York ham in cut, it should be
    flanked by a Westphalian ditto. For the blend
    is a good one. And remember that no York
    ham under 20 lb. in weight is worth cutting.
    You need not put it all on the board at once.
    A capital adjunct to the breakfast-table, too, is a
    reindeer&rsquo;s tongue, which, as you see it hung up in
    the shops, looks more like a policeman&rsquo;s truncheon
    in active employment than anything else; but
    when well soaked and then properly treated in
    the boiling, is very tasty, and will melt like
    marrow in the mouth.</p>
<p>A simple, excellent August breakfast can be
    made from a dish of freshly-caught trout, the legs
    and back of a cold grouse, which has been roasted, <i>not</i> baked, and</p>
<h4><i>A Large Peach</i>.</h4>
<p>But what of the wretched bachelor, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> enters his one sitting-room, in his humble lodging?
    He may have heard the chimes at midnight,
    in some gay and festive quarter, or, like
    some other wretched bachelors, he may have
    been engaged in the composition of romances
    for some exacting editor, until the smallish
    hours. Poor outcast! what sort of appetite will
    he have for the rusty rasher, or the shop egg, the
    smoked haddock, or the &ldquo;Billingsgate pheasant,&rdquo;
    which his landlady will presently send up, together
    with her little account, for his refection?
    Well, here is a much more tasty dish than any
    of the above; and if he be &ldquo;square&rdquo; with Mrs.
    Bangham, that lady will possibly not object to
    her &ldquo;gal&rdquo; cooking the different ingredients
    before she starts at the wash-tub. But let not
    the wretched bachelor suffer the &ldquo;gal&rdquo; to mix
    them.</p>
<p>I first met this dish in Calcutta during the
    two months of (alleged) cold weather which
    prevail during the year.</p>
<h4><i>Calcutta Jumble.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>A few fried fillets of white fish (sole, or plaice&mdash;sole
        for choice), placed on the top of some boiled
        rice, in a soup plate. Pour over them the yolks of
        two <i>boiled</i> eggs, and mix in one green chili, chopped
        fine. Salt to taste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Another way:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Mix with the rice the following ingredients:&mdash;</p>
    <p class="blockquot">The  yolks of two <i>raw</i> eggs, one tablespoonful
        anchovy sauce, one <i>small</i> teaspoonful curry powder
        (raw), a sprinkling of cayenne, a little salt, and one
        green chili chopped fine. Each ingredient to be<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a> added separately, and the eggs and curry powder to
        be stirred into the rice with a fork. Fillets of sole
        to be served atop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many cooks in this England of ours can
    cook rice properly? Without pausing for a
    reply, I append the recipe, which should be
    pasted on the wall of every kitchen. The many
    cookery books which I have read give elaborate
    directions for the performance, of what is a very
    simple duty. Here it is, in a few lines&mdash;</p>
<h4><i>To cook Rice for Curry, etc.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Soak a sufficiency of rice in cold water for two
        hours. Strain through a sieve, and pop the rice into <i>boiling</i> water. Let it boil&mdash;&ldquo;gallop&rdquo; is, I believe,
        the word used in most kitchens&mdash;for not quite ten
        minutes (or until the rice is tender), then strain off
        the water through a sieve, and dash a little <i>cold</i> water over the rice, to separate the grains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another most appetising breakfast
    dish for the springtime&mdash;</p>
<h4><i>Asparagus with Eggs</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Cut up two dozen (or so) heads of cooked
        asparagus into small pieces, and mix in a stewpan
        with the well-beaten yolks of two raw eggs.
        Flavour with pepper and salt, and stir freely. Add
        a piece of butter the size of a walnut (one of these
        should be kept in every kitchen as a pattern), and
        keep on stirring for a couple of minutes or so.
        Serve on delicately-toasted bread.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>An Hotel Breakfast.</i></h4>
<p>What memories do these words conjure up of
    a snug coffee-room, hung with hunting prints,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> and portraits of Derby winners, and churches,
    and well-hung game; with its oak panellings,
    easy arm-chairs, blazing fire, snowy naperies,
    and bright silver. The cheery host, with well-lined
    paunch, and fat, wheezy voice, which
    wishes you good-morning, and hopes you have
    passed a comfortable night between the lavender-scented
    sheets. The fatherly interest which
    &ldquo;William,&rdquo; the grey-headed waiter, takes in
    you&mdash;stranger or <i>habitué</i>&mdash;and the more than
    fatherly interest which you take in the good
    cheer, from home-made &ldquo;sassingers&rdquo; to new-laid
    eggs, and heather honey, not forgetting a slice
    out of the mammoth York ham, beneath whose
    weight the old sideboard absolutely grunts.</p>
<p>Heigho! we, or they, have changed all that.
    The poet who found his &ldquo;warmest welcome in
    an inn&rdquo; was, naturally enough, writing of his
    own time. I don&rsquo;t like fault-finding, but must
    needs declare that the &ldquo;warmest&rdquo; part of an
    inn welcome to be found nowadays is the bill.
    As long as you pay it (or have plenty of luggage
    to leave behind in default), and make yourself
    agreeable to the fair and haughty bookkeeper
    (if it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;she&rdquo;) who allots you your bedroom,
    and bullies the page-boy, nobody in the modern
    inn cares particularly what becomes of you. You
    lose your individuality, and become &ldquo;Number
    325.&rdquo; Instead of welcome, distrust lurks, large,
    on the very threshold.</p>
<h4>&ldquo;<i>No Cheques Accepted</i>&rdquo;</h4>
<p>is frequently the first announcement to catch the
    eye of the incoming guest; and although you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> cannot help admiring the marble pillars, the oak
    carving, the gilding, the mirrors, and the electric
    light, an uncomfortable feeling comes over you
    at meal times, to the effect that the cost of the
    decorations, or much of it, is taken out of the
    food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiter,&rdquo; you ask, as soon as your eyes and
    ears get accustomed to the incessant bustle of
    the coffee-room, and your nostrils to the savour
    of last night&rsquo;s soup, &ldquo;what can I have for
    breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you like, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like a grilled sole, to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sorry, sir, soles is hoff&mdash;get you a nice
    chop or steak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t manage either so early in the day.
    Got any whitings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid we&rsquo;re out of whitings, sir, but I&rsquo;ll
    see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually, after suggesting sundry delicacies,
    all of which are either &ldquo;hoff,&rdquo; or unknown to
    the waiter, you settle down to the consumption
    of two fried and shrivelled shop eggs, on an
    island of Chicago ham, floating in an Ægean Sea
    of grease and hot water; whilst a half quartern
    loaf, a cruet-stand the size of a cathedral, a
    rackful of toast of the &ldquo;Zebra&rdquo; brand, and about
    two gallons of (alleged) coffee, are dumped down
    in succession in front of you.</p>
<p>There are, of course, some hostelries where
    they &ldquo;do&rdquo; you better than this, but my experience
    of hotel breakfasts at this end of the
    nineteenth century has not been encouraging,
    either to appetite or temper; and I do vow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> protest that the above picture is not too highly
    coloured.</p>
<p>The toothsome, necessary bloater is not often
    to be met with on the hotel&rsquo;s bill-of-fare; but,
    if soft roed&mdash;use no other&mdash;it will repay perusal.
    Toast it in a Dutch oven in front of a clear fire,
    and just before done split it up the back, and put
    a piece of butter on it. The roe should be well
    plumped, and of the consistency of Devonshire
    cream. A grilled sole for breakfast is preferable
    to a fried one, principally because it is by no
    means impossible that the fried sole be second-hand,
    or as the French call it <i>réchauffé</i>. And
    why, unless directions to the contrary be given,
    is the modest whiting invariably placed, tail in
    mouth, on the frying pan? A grilled whiting&mdash;assassinate
    your cook if she (or he) scorches
    it&mdash;is one of the noblest works of the kitchen, and
    its exterior should be of a golden brown colour.</p>
<p>Do not forget to order sausages for breakfast if
    you are staying at Newmarket; there is less
    bread in them than in the Metropolitan brand.
    And when in Lincoln attempt a</p>
<h4><i>Halibut Steak</i>,</h4>
<p>of which you may not have previously heard.
    The halibut should, previous to grilling or frying <i>in salad oil</i>, be placed on a shallow dish and
    sprinkled with salt. Then the dish should be
    half filled with water, which must not cover the
    salt. Leave the fish to soak for an hour, then
    cut into slices, nearly an inch thick, without
    removing the skin. Sprinkle some lemon juice
    and cayenne over the steaks before serving.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>If you wish to preserve an even mind, and be
    at peace with the world, a visit to</p>
<h4><i>The Hotel Parish</i></h4>
<p>is not to be recommended. The Irish stew at
    dinner is not bad in its way, though coarse, and
    too liberally endowed with fat. But the breakfasts!
    Boiled oatmeal and water, with salt in
    the mess, and a chunk of stale brown bread to
    eat therewith, do not constitute an altogether
    satisfactory meal, the first thing in the morning;
    and it is hardly calculated to inspire him with
    much pride in his work, when the guest is placed
    subsequently before his &ldquo;task&rdquo; of unbroken flints
    or tarred rope.</p>

<p>For a &ldquo;warm welcome&rdquo; commend me to Bonnie
    Scotland. Though hard of head and &ldquo;sae fu&rsquo; o&rsquo;
    learning&rdquo; that they are &ldquo;owre deeficult to conveence,
    ye ken,&rdquo; these rugged Caledonians be
    tender of heart, and philanthropic to a degree.
    Hech, sirs! but &rsquo;tis the braw time ye&rsquo;ll hae, gin

    well for the matter o&rsquo; that&mdash;in search o&rsquo; guid
    refreshment for body an&rsquo; soul.</p>
<p>Even that surly lexicographer, Doctor Samuel
    Johnson (who, by the way, claimed the same
    city for his birthplace as does the writer), who
    could not be induced to recognise the merits of
    Scotch scenery, and preferred Fleet Street to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> the Trossachs, extolled the luxury of a Scotch
    breakfast above that of all other countries. And
    Sir Walter Scott, who never enthused much about
    meat and drink, is responsible in <i>Waverley</i> for
    a passage calculated to make the mouths of most
    people water:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He found Miss Bradwardine presiding over
    the tea and coffee, the table loaded with warm
    bread, both of flour, oatmeal, and barley meal, in
    the shape of loaves, cakes, biscuits, and other
    varieties, together with eggs, reindeer ham,
    mutton and beef ditto, smoked salmon, and
    many other delicacies. A mess of oatmeal
    porridge, flanked by a silver jug which held an
    equal mixture of cream and buttermilk, was
    placed for the Baron&rsquo;s share of the repast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; as Mr. Samuel Weller would have
    observed, &ldquo;a wery good idea of a breakfast, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A beef-ham sounds like a &ldquo;large order&rdquo; for
    breakfast, even when we come to consider that
    the Scotch &ldquo;beastie,&rdquo; in Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s time,
    was wanting in &ldquo;beam&rdquo; and stature. I have
    seen and partaken of a ham cut from a Yorkshire
    pig, and weighing 52 lbs.; but even a Scotch
    beef-ham must have topped that weight considerably.
    Fortunately the sideboards of those
    times were substantial of build.</p>
<p>Missing from the above bill-of-fare is the
    haddock,</p>
<h4><i>The Fin&rsquo;an Haddie</i>,</h4>
<p>a bird which at that period had probably not been
    invented. But the modern Scottish breakfast-table
    is not properly furnished without it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> genuine &ldquo;Fin&rsquo;an&rdquo; is known by its appetising
    savour and by its colour&mdash;a creamy yellow, which
    is totally distinct from the Vandyke browny hue
    of the haddock which is creosoted in the neighbourhood
    of the Blackfriars Road, London, S.E.
    &ldquo;Strip off the skin,&rdquo; says the recipe in one cookery
    book, &ldquo;and broil before the fire or over a quick
    clear one.&rdquo; Another way&mdash;<i>my</i> way&mdash;is <i>not</i> to
    strip off the skin and to <i>steam</i> your haddies.
    Place them in a dish which has been previously
    heated. Throw boiling water on them, and
    cover closely with a plate; place on a hot stove,
    and in from 10 to 15 minutes the Fin&rsquo;ans will
    be accomplished. Drain, and serve hot as hot,
    buttered, with a sprinkling of cayenne, and, maybe,
    a dash of Worcester sauce.</p>
<p>Salmon is naturally a welcome guest at the
    table of the land of his birth, served fresh when
    in season, and smoked or kippered at all times.</p>
<h4><i>A Salmon Steak</i></h4>
<p>with the &ldquo;curd&rdquo; between the flakes, placed
    within a coat of virgin-white paper (oiled) and
    grilled for 15 minutes or so, is an excellent
    breakfast dish. A fry of small troutlets, a ditto
    of the deer&rsquo;s interior economy&mdash;<i>Mem.</i> When up
    at the death of a hunted stag, always beg or
    annex a portion of his liver&mdash;are also common
    dishes at the first meal served by the &ldquo;gudewife&rdquo;;
    and I once met a cold haggis at 9.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> But
    this, I rather fancy, was &ldquo;a wee bit joke&rdquo; at my
    expense. Anyhow I shall have plenty to say
    about the &ldquo;great chieftain o&rsquo; the puddin&rsquo; race&rdquo;
    in a later chapter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Off to Gold-land!</i></h4>
<p>Those that go down to the sea in ships, and
    can summon up sufficient presence of mind to
    go down to the saloon at meal times, have far
    from a bad time of it. Living was certainly
    better on the ocean wave in the days when livestock
    was kept on board, and slaughtered as
    required; for the effect of keeping beef, pork,
    and mutton in a refrigerating chamber for any
    length of time is to destroy the flavour, and
    to render beef indistinguishable from the flesh of
    the hog, and mutton as tasteless as infantine pap.
    But the ship&rsquo;s galley does its little utmost; and
    the saloon passenger, on his way to the other side
    of the equator, may regale himself with such a
    breakfast as the following, which is taken from
    the steward&rsquo;s book of a vessel belonging to the
    Union Line:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Porridge, fillets of haddock with fine herbs, mutton
        chops and chip potatoes, savoury omelet, bacon on
        toast, minced collops, curry and rice, fruit, rolls,
        toast, etc., tea and coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cannot my readers imagine a steward entering
    the state-room of the voyager who has succumbed
    to the wiles and eccentricities of the Bay of
    Biscay, with the observation: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you get
    up to breakfast, sir?&mdash;I&rsquo;ve reserved a <i>beautiful</i> fat
    chop, with chips, o&rsquo; purpose for you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the lot of the third-class passenger who
    is conveyed from his native land to the Cape of
    Good Hope, for what Mr. Montague Tigg would
    have called &ldquo;the ridiculous sum of&rdquo; £16: 16s.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> is no such hard one, seeing that he is allotted a
    &ldquo;bunk&rdquo; in a compact, though comfortable cabin,
    and may break his fast on the following substantial
    meal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Porridge, Yarmouth bloaters, potatoes, American
        hash, grilled mutton, bread and butter, tea or coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An American breakfast is as variegated (and I
    fear I must add, as indigestible) as a Scotch one;
    and included in the bill of fare are as many, or
    more, varieties of bread and cake as are to be
    found in the land o&rsquo; shortbread. The writer has,
    in New York, started the morning meal with
    oysters, run the gamut of fish, flesh, and fowl,
    and wound up with buckwheat cakes, which are
    brought on in relays, buttered and smoking hot,
    and can be eaten with or without golden syrup.
    But, as business begins early in New York and
    other large cities, scant attention is paid to the
    first meal by the merchant and the speculator,
    who are wont to &ldquo;gallop&rdquo; through breakfast and
    luncheon, and to put in their &ldquo;best work&rdquo; at
    dinner.</p>
<h4><i>A Mediterranean Breakfast</i></h4>
<p>is not lacking in poetry; and the jaded denizen
    of Malta can enjoy red mullet (the &ldquo;woodcock
    of the sea&rdquo;) freshly taken from the tideless
    ocean, and strawberries in perfection, at his first
    meal, whilst seated, maybe, next to some dreamy-eyed <i>houri</i>, who coos soft nothings into his ear,
    at intervals. The wines of Italy go best with
    this sort of repast, which is generally eaten with
    &ldquo;spoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>In fair France, breakfast, or the <i>déjeûner à la
    fourchette</i>, is not served until noon, or thereabouts.
    Coffee or chocolate, with fancy bread and butter,
    is on hand as soon as you wake; and I have
    heard that for the roisterer and the <i>p&rsquo;tit crevé</i> there be such liquors as <i>cognac</i>, <i>curaçoa</i>, and <i>chartreuse verte</i> provided at the first meal, so
    that nerves can be strung together and headaches
    alleviated before the &ldquo;associated&rdquo; breakfast at
    midday. In the country, at the <i>château</i> of <i>Monsieur et Madame</i>, the groom-of-the-chambers,
    or <i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i>, as he is designated, knocks at
    your bedroom door at about 8.30.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, <i>M&rsquo;sieu</i>. Will <i>M&rsquo;sieu</i> partake
    of the <i>chocolat</i>, or of the <i>café-au-lait</i>, or of the
    tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon ordinary occasions, <i>M&rsquo;sieu</i> will partake of
    the <i>chocolat</i>&mdash;if he be of French extraction;
    whilst the English visitor will partake of the <i>café-au-lait</i>&mdash;tea-making in France being still in
    its infancy. And if <i>M&rsquo;sieu</i> has gazed too long on
    the wine of the country, overnight, he will occasionally&mdash;reprobate
    that he is&mdash;partake instead of
    the <i>vieux cognac</i>, diluted from the syphon. And <i>M&rsquo;sieu</i> never sees his host or hostess till the
    &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; sounds for the midday meal.</p>
<p>I have alluded, just above, to French tea-making.
    There was a time when tea, with our
    lively neighbours, was as scarce a commodity as
    snakes in Iceland or rum punch in Holloway
    Castle. Then the thin end of the wedge was
    introduced, and the English visitor was invited to
    partake of a cup of what was called (by courtesy)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> <i>thé</i>, which had been concocted expressly for her
    or him. And tea <i>à la Française</i> used to be
    made somewhat after this fashion. The cup was
    half-filled with milk, sugar <i>à discrétion</i> being
    added. A little silver sieve was next placed over the
    cup, and from a jug sufficient hot water, in which
    had been previously left to soak some half-dozen
    leaf-fragments of green tea, to fill the cup, was
    poured forth. In fact the visitor was invited to
    drink a very nasty compound indeed, something
    like the &ldquo;wish&rdquo; tea with which the school-mistress
    used to regale her victims&mdash;milk and
    water, and &ldquo;wish-you-may-get&rdquo; tea! But they
    have changed all that across the Channel, and
    five o&rsquo;clock tea is one of the most fashionable
    functions of the day, with the <i>beau monde</i>; a
    favourite invitation of the society <i>belle</i> of the <i>fin de
    siècle</i> being: &ldquo;<i>Voulex-vous fivoclocquer avec moi?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>déjeûner</i> usually begins with a <i>consommé</i>, a
    thin, clear, soup, not quite adapted to stave off
    the pangs of hunger by itself, but grateful enough
    by way of a commencement. Then follows an
    array of dishes containing fish and fowl of sorts,
    with the inevitable <i>côtelettes à la</i> somebody-or-other,
    not forgetting an <i>omelette</i>&mdash;a mess which
    the French cook alone knows how to concoct to
    perfection. The meal is usually washed down
    with some sort of claret; and a subsequent <i>café</i>,
    with the accustomed <i>chasse</i>; whilst the welcome <i>cigarette</i> is not &ldquo;defended,&rdquo; even in the mansions
    of the great.</p>
<p>There is more than one way of making coffee,
    that of the lodging-house &ldquo;general,&rdquo; and of the
    street-stall dispenser, during the small hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> being amongst the least commendable. Without
    posing as an infallible manufacturer of the refreshing
    (though indigestible, to many people)
    beverage, I would urge that it be made from
    freshly-roasted seed, ground just before wanted.
    Then heat the ground coffee in the oven, and
    place upon the perforated bottom of the upper
    compartment of a <i>cafetière</i>, put the strainer on
    it, and pour in boiling water, gradually. &ldquo;The
    Duke&rdquo; in <i>Geneviève de Brabant</i> used to warble
    as part of a song in praise of tea&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left:20%">
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">And &rsquo;tis also most important<br />
            </span> <span class="i2">That you should not spare the tea.<br />
            </span> </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>So is it of equal importance that you should
    not spare the coffee. There are more elaborate
    ways of making coffee; but none that the writer
    has tried are in front of the old <i>cafetière</i>, if the
    simple directions given above be carried out in
    their entirety.</p>
<p>As in France, sojourners (for their sins) in
    the burning plains of Ind have their first breakfast,
    or <i>chota hazri</i>, at an early hour, whilst the
    breakfast proper&mdash;usually described in Lower
    Bengal, Madras, and Bombay as &ldquo;tiffin&rdquo;&mdash;comes
    later on. For</p>
<h4><i>Chota Hazri</i></h4>
<p>(literally &ldquo;little breakfast&rdquo;)&mdash;which is served
    either at the Mess-house, the public Bath, or in
    one&rsquo;s own bungalow, beneath the verandah&mdash;poached
    eggs on toast are <i>de rigueur</i>, whilst I have
    met such additions as <i>unda ishcamble</i> (scrambled
    eggs), potato cake, and (naughty, naughty!)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> anchovy toast. Tea or coffee are always drunk
    with this meal. &ldquo;Always,&rdquo; have I written?
    Alas! In my mind&rsquo;s eye I can see the poor
    Indian vainly trying to stop the too-free flow of
    the <i>Belati pani</i> (literally &ldquo;Europe water&rdquo;) by
    thrusting a dusky thumb into the neck of the
    just-opened bottle, and in my mind&rsquo;s ear can I
    catch the blasphemous observation of the subaltern
    as he remarks to his slave that he does not require,
    in his morning&rsquo;s &ldquo;livener,&rdquo; the additional flavour
    of Mahommedan flesh, and the &ldquo;hubble-bubble&rdquo;
    pipe, the tobacco in which may have been
    stirred by the same thumb that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee shop&rdquo; is a favourite function, during
    the march of a regiment in India, at least it used
    to be in the olden time, before troops were
    conveyed by railway. <i>Dhoolies</i> (roughly made
    palanquins) laden with meat and drink were
    sent on half way, overnight; and grateful indeed
    was the cup of tea, or coffee, or the &ldquo;peg&rdquo;
    which was poured forth for the weary warrior
    who had been &ldquo;tramping it&rdquo; or in the saddle
    since 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> or some such unearthly hour, in
    order that the column might reach the new
    camping-ground before the sun was high in the
    heavens. It was at &ldquo;coffee-shop&rdquo; that &ldquo;chaff&rdquo;
    reigned supreme, and speculations as to what the
    shooting would be like at the next place were
    indulged in. And when that shooting was likely
    to take the form of long men, armed with long
    guns, and long knives, the viands, which consisted
    for the most part of toast, biscuits, poached
    eggs, and <i>unda bakum</i> (eggs and bacon), were
    devoured with appetites all the keener for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> prospect in view. It is in troublous times, be
    it further observed, that the Hindustan <i>khit</i> is
    seen at his best. On the field of battle itself I
    have known coffee and boiled eggs&mdash;or even a
    grilled fowl&mdash;produced by the fearless and devoted <i>nokhur</i>, from, apparently, nowhere at all.</p>
<p>At the Indian breakfast proper, all sorts of
    viands are consumed; from the curried prawns
    and Europe provisions (which arrive in an hermetically
    sealed condition per s.s. <i>Nomattawot</i>),
    to the rooster who heralds your arrival at the <i>dak</i> bungalow, with much crowing, and who
    within half an hour of your advent has been
    successively chased into a corner, beheaded,
    plucked, and served up for your refection in a
    scorched state. I have breakfasted off such
    assorted food as curried locusts, boiled leg of
    mutton, fried snipe, Europe sausages, <i>Iron ishtoo</i> (Irish stew), <i>vilolif</i> (veal olives, and more correctly
    a dinner dish), kidney toast&mdash;chopped sheep&rsquo;s
    kidneys, highly seasoned with pepper, lime-juice,
    and Worcester sauce, very appetising&mdash;parrot
    pie, eggs and bacon, omelette (which might also
    have been used to patch ammunition boots with),
    sardines, fried fish (mind the bones of the Asiatic
    fish), <i>bifishtake</i> (beef steak), goat chops, curries
    of all sorts, hashed venison, and roast peafowl,
    ditto quail, ditto pretty nearly everything that
    flies, cold buffalo hump, grilled sheep&rsquo;s tail (a
    bit bilious), hermetically-sealed herring, turtle
    fins, Guava jelly, preserved mango, home-made
    cake, and many other things which have escaped
    memory. I am coming to the &ldquo;curry&rdquo; part of
    the entertainment later on in the volume, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> may remark that it is preferable when eaten in
    the middle of the day. My own experience was
    that few people touched curry when served in
    its normal place at dinner&mdash;as a course of itself&mdash;just
    before the sweets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breakfast with my tutor!&rdquo; What happy
    memories of boyhood do not the words conjure
    up, of the usually stern, unbending preceptor
    pouring out the coffee, and helping the sausages
    and mashed potatoes&mdash;we always had what is
    now known as &ldquo;saus and mash&rdquo; at my tutor&rsquo;s&mdash;and
    the fatherly air with which he would remind
    the juvenile glutton, who had seated himself just
    opposite the apricot jam, and was improving the
    occasion, that eleven o&rsquo;clock school would be in
    full swing in half an hour, and that the brain
    (and, by process of reasoning, the stomach) could
    not be in too good working-order for the fervid
    young student of Herodotus. The ordinary
    breakfast of the &ldquo;lower boy&rdquo; at Eton used to be
    of a very uncertain pattern. Indeed, what with
    &ldquo;fagging,&rdquo; the preparation of his lord-and-master&rsquo;s
    breakfast, the preparation of &ldquo;pupil-room&rdquo;
    work, and agile and acute scouts ever on
    the alert to pilfer his roll and pat of butter, that
    boy was lucky if he got any breakfast at all. If
    he possessed capital, or credit, he might certainly
    stave off starvation at &ldquo;Brown&rsquo;s,&rdquo; with buttered
    buns and pickled salmon; or at &ldquo;Webber&rsquo;s,&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;the Wall,&rdquo; with three-cornered jam tarts, or
    a &ldquo;strawberry mess&rdquo;; but Smith <i>minor</i>, and
    Jones <i>minimus</i> as often as not, went breakfastless
    to second school.</p>
<p>At the University, breakfast with &ldquo;the Head&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> or any other &ldquo;Don&rdquo; was a rather solemn function.
    The table well and plentifully laid, and the host
    hospitality itself, but occasionally, nay, frequently,
    occupied with other thoughts. A departed
    friend used to tell a story of a breakfast of this
    description. He was shaken warmly by the
    hand by his host, who afterwards lapsed into
    silence. My friend, to &ldquo;force the running,&rdquo;
    ventured on the observation&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a remarkably fine morning, sir, is it
    not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No reply came. In fact, the great man&rsquo;s
    thoughts were so preoccupied with Greek roots,
    and other defunct horrors, that he spoke not a
    word during breakfast. But when, an hour or
    so afterwards, the time came for his guest to take
    leave, the &ldquo;Head&rdquo; shook him by the hand
    warmly once more, and remarked abstractedly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know, Mr. Johnson, I don&rsquo;t think
    that was a particularly original remark of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;More honoured in the breach,&rsquo; do you say,
    Mr. Author?&rdquo; I fancy I hear some reader inquire.
    &ldquo;Are these your sentiments? Do you
    really mean them?&rdquo; Well, perhaps, they ought
    to be qualified. Unless a man breakfast very
    early, and dine very late, he cannot do himself
    much good by eating a square meal at 1.30 or
    2.0 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> There can be no question but that
    whilst thousands of the lieges&mdash;despite soup-kitchens,
    workhouses, and gaols&mdash;perish of
    absolute starvation, as many of their more fortunate
    brethren perish, in the course of time, from
    gluttony, from falling down (sometimes literally)
    and worshipping the Belly-god.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>Years ago Sir Henry Thompson observed to a
    friend of the writer&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most men who seek my advice are suffering
    under one of two great evils&mdash;eating too much
    good food, or drinking too much bad liquor; and
    occasionally they suffer under both evils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This luncheon,&rdquo; writes Oliver Wendell
    Holmes, &ldquo;is a very convenient affair; it does
    not require any special dress; it is informal;
    and can be light or heavy as one chooses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American&mdash;the male American at all
    events&mdash;takes far more count of luncheon than
    of breakfast.</p>
<p>But in many cases luncheon and early dinner
    are synonymous terms. Take the family
    luncheon, for instance, of the middle classes,
    where mother, governess, and little ones all
    assemble in front of the roast and boiled, at the
    principal meal of the day, and the more or less
    snowy tablecloth is duly anointed with gravy
    by &ldquo;poor baby,&rdquo; in her high chair, and the
    youngest but one is slapped at intervals by his
    instructress, for using his knife for the peas&mdash;at
    the risk of enlarging his mouth&mdash;or for
    swallowing the stones of the cherries which
    have been dealt him, or her, from the tart.
    This is not the sort of meal for the male friend
    of the family to &ldquo;drop in&rdquo; at, if he value the
    lapels of his new frock-coat, and be given to
    blushing. For children have not only an evil
    habit of &ldquo;pawing&rdquo; the visitor with jammy
    fingers, but occasionally narrate somewhat
    &ldquo;risky&rdquo; anecdotes. And a child&rsquo;s ideas of
    the Christian religion, nay, of the Creator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> himself, are occasionally more quaint than
    reverent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma, dear,&rdquo; once lisped a sweet little thing
    of six, &ldquo;what doth God have for hith dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S-sh-sh, my child!&rdquo; replied the horrified
    mother, &ldquo;you must not ask such dreadful
    questions. God doesn&rsquo;t want any dinner, remember
    that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h!&rdquo; continued the unabashed and
    dissatisfied <i>enfant terrible</i>. And, after a pause,
    &ldquo;then I thuppose he hath an egg with hith tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a country-house, of course, but few of the
    male guests turn up at the domestic luncheon,
    being otherwise engaged in killing something,
    or in trying to kill something, or in that sport
    which is but partially understood out of Great
    Britain&mdash;the pursuit of an evil-savoured animal
    who is practically worthless to civilisation after
    his capture and death.</p>
<p>It is in &ldquo;the City&rdquo; that vile man, perhaps,
    puts in his best work as an eater of luncheons.
    Some city men there be, of course&mdash;poor,
    wretched, half-starved clerks, whose state nobody
    ever seems to attempt to ameliorate&mdash;whose
    midday refections are not such as would have
    earned a meed of commendation from the late
    Vitellius, or from the late Colonel North. For
    said refections but seldom consist of more important
    items than a thick slice of bread and a
    stale bloater; or possibly a home-made sandwich
    of bread and Dutch cheese&mdash;the whole washed
    down with a tumbler of milk, or more often a
    tumbler of the fluid supplied by the New River
    Company. During the winter months a pennyworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> of roasted chestnuts supplies a filling,
    though indigestible meal to many a man
    whose employer is swilling turtle at Birch&rsquo;s or
    at the big house in Leadenhall Street, and
    who is compelled, by the exigencies of custom,
    to wear a decent black coat and some sort of
    tall hat when on his way to and from
    &ldquo;business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the more fortunate citizens&mdash;how do they
    &ldquo;do themselves&rdquo; at luncheon? For some there
    is the cheap soup-house, or the chop-and-steak
    house reviled of Dickens, and but little changed
    since the time of the great novelist. Then, for
    the &ldquo;gilt-edged&rdquo; division there is</p>
<h4><i>Birch&rsquo;s</i>,</h4>
<p>the little green house which, although now
    &ldquo;run&rdquo; by those eminent caterers, Messrs. Ring
    and Brymer, is still known by the name of the
    old Alderman who deserved so well of his
    fellow citizens, and who, whilst a <i>cordon bleu</i> of
    some celebrity, had also a pretty taste as a playwright.
    The old house has not changed one
    jot, either in appearance, customs, or fare. At
    the little counter on the ground floor may be
    obtained the same cheesecakes, tartlets, baked
    custards, and calf&rsquo;s-foot jellies which delighted
    our grandfathers, and the same brand of Scottish
    whisky. Upstairs, in the soup-rooms, some of
    the tables are covered with damask tablecloths,
    whilst at others a small square of napery but
    partially obscures the view of the well-polished
    mahogany.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Turtle Soup</i></h4>
<p>is still served on silver plates, whilst the cheaper
    juices of the bullock, the calf, and the pea,
    &ldquo;with the usual trimmings,&rdquo; repose temporarily
    on china or earthenware. <i>Pâtés</i>, whether of
    oyster, lobster, chicken, or veal-and-ham, are still
    in favour with <i>habitué</i> and chance customer
    alike, and no wonder, for these are something
    like <i>pâtés</i>. The &ldquo;filling&rdquo; is kept hot like the
    soups, in huge stewpans, on the range, and when
    required is ladled out into a plate, and furnished
    with top and bottom crust&mdash;and such crust,
    flaky and light to a degree; and how different
    to the confectioner&rsquo;s or railway-refreshment <i>pâté</i>,
    which, when an orifice be made in the covering
    with a pickaxe, reveals nothing more appetising
    than what appear to be four small cubes of frost-bitten
    india-rubber, with a portion or two of
    candle end.</p>
<p>A more advanced meal is served in Leadenhall
    Street, at</p>
<h4>&ldquo;<i>The Ship and Turtle</i>,&rdquo;</h4>
<p>said to be the oldest tavern in London, and
    which has been more than once swept and
    garnished, and reformed altogether, since its
    establishment during the reign of King Richard
    II. But they could have known but little about
    the superior advantages offered by the turtle as
    a life-sustainer, in those days; whereas at the
    present day some hundreds of the succulent
    reptiles die the death on the premises, within a
    month, in order that city companies, and stockbrokers,
    and merchants of sorts, and mining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> millionaires, and bicycle makers, and other
    estimable people, may dine and lunch.</p>
<p>Then there are the numerous clubs, not forgetting
    one almost at the very door of &ldquo;The
    House,&rdquo; where the 2000 odd (some of them <i>very</i> odd) members are regaled on the fat of the land
    in general, and of the turtle in particular, day by
    day; and that mammoth underground palace the
    &ldquo;Palmerston,&rdquo; where any kind of banquet can be
    served up at a few minutes&rsquo; notice, and where
    &ldquo;special Greek dishes&rdquo; are provided for the
    gamblers in wheat and other cereals, at the
    adjacent &ldquo;Baltic.&rdquo; There be also other eating-houses,
    far too numerous to mention, but most
    of them worth a visit.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;filling&rdquo; sort of luncheon is a portion of a</p>
<h4><i>Cheshire Cheese Pudding</i>.</h4>
<p>A little way up a gloomy court on the north
    side of Fleet Street&mdash;a neighbourhood which
    reeks of printers&rsquo; ink, bookmakers&rsquo; &ldquo;runners,&rdquo;
    tipsters, habitual borrowers of small pieces of
    silver, and that &ldquo;warm&rdquo; smell of burning paste
    and molten lead which indicates the &ldquo;foundry&rdquo;
    in a printing works&mdash;is situated this ancient
    hostelry. It is claimed for the &ldquo;Cheese&rdquo; that
    it was the tavern most frequented by Dr.
    Samuel Johnson. Mr. C. Redding, in his <i>Fifty
    Years&rsquo; Recollections, Literary and Personal</i>,
    published in 1858, says: &ldquo;I often dined at the</p>
<h4>&ldquo;<i>Cheshire Cheese</i>.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Johnson and his friends, I was informed, used to
    do the same, and I was told I should see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> individuals who had met them there. This I found
    to be correct. The company was more select
    than in later times, but there are Fleet Street
    tradesmen who well remembered both Johnson
    and Goldsmith in this place of entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few Americans who visit our metropolis go
    away without making a pilgrimage to this ancient
    hostelry, where, upstairs, &ldquo;Doctor Johnson&rsquo;s
    Chair&rdquo; is on view; and many visitors carry
    away mementoes of the house, in the shape of
    pewter measures, the oaken platters upon which
    these are placed, and even samples of the long
    &ldquo;churchwarden&rdquo; pipes, smoked by <i>habitués</i> after
    their evening chops or steaks.</p>
<h4><i>Ye Pudding</i>,</h4>
<p>which is served on Wednesdays and Saturdays,
    at 1.30 and 6.0, is a formidable-looking object,
    and its savour reaches even into the uttermost
    parts of Great Grub Street. As large, more or
    less, as the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s, that pudding is
    stuffed with steak, kidney, oysters, mushrooms,
    and larks. The irreverent call these last named
    sparrows, but we know better. This pudding
    takes (<i>on dit</i>) 17½ hours in the boiling, and the
    &ldquo;bottom crust&rdquo; would have delighted the hearts
    of Johnson, Boswell, and Co., in whose days the
    savoury dish was not. The writer once witnessed
    a catastrophe at the &ldquo;Cheshire Cheese,&rdquo; compared
    to which the burning of Moscow or the
    bombardment of Alexandria were mere trifles.
    1.30 on Saturday afternoon had arrived, and the
    oaken benches in the refectory were filled to
    repletion with expectant pudding-eaters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> Burgesses of the City of London were there&mdash;good,
    &ldquo;warm,&rdquo; round-bellied men, with plough-boys&rsquo;
    appetites&mdash;and journalists, and advertising agents,
    and &ldquo;resting&rdquo; actors, and magistrates&rsquo; clerks, and
    barristers from the Temple, and well-to-do
    tradesmen. Sherry and gin and bitters and other
    adventitious aids (?) to appetite had been done
    justice to, and the arrival of the &ldquo;procession&rdquo;&mdash;it
    takes three men and a boy to carry the <i>pièce
    de résistance</i> from the kitchen to the dining-room&mdash;was
    anxiously awaited. And then, of a sudden
    we heard a loud crash! followed by a feminine
    shriek, and an unwhispered Saxon oath. &ldquo;Tom&rdquo;
    the waiter had slipped, released his hold, and the
    pudding had fallen downstairs! It was a sight
    ever to be remembered&mdash;steak, larks, oysters,
    &ldquo;delicious gravy,&rdquo; running in a torrent into
    Wine Office Court. The expectant diners
    (many of them lunchers) stood up and gazed
    upon the wreck of their hopes, and then filed,
    silently and sadly, outside. Such a catastrophe
    had not been known in Brainland since the
    Great Fire.</p>
<p>Puddings of all sorts are, in fact, favourite
    autumn and winter luncheon dishes in London,
    and the man who can &ldquo;come twice&rdquo; at such a
    &ldquo;dream&rdquo; as the following, between the hours of
    one and three, can hardly be in devouring trim for
    his evening meal till very late. It is a</p>
<h4><i>Snipe Pudding</i>.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A <i>thin</i> slice of beef-skirt,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> seasoned with pepper
        and salt, at the bottom of the basin; then three
        snipes beheaded and befooted, and with gizzards
        extracted. Leave the liver and heart in, an you
        value your life. Cover up with paste, and boil (or
        steam) for two-and-a-half hours. For stockbrokers
        and bookmakers, mushrooms and truffles are sometimes
        placed within this pudding; but it is better
        without&mdash;according to the writer&rsquo;s notion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the fowls of the air may be treated in
    the same way. And when eating cold grouse for
    luncheon try (if you can get it) a fruit salad
    therewith. You will find preserved peaches,
    apricots, and cherries in syrup, harmonise well
    with cold <i>brown</i> game.</p>
<h4><i>Lancashire Hot-Pot</i></h4>
<p>is a savoury dish indeed; but I know of but one
    eating-house in London where you can get
    anything like it. Here is the recipe&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Place a layer of mutton cutlets, with most of the
        fat and tails trimmed off, at the bottom of a deep
        earthenware stewpan. Then a layer of chopped
        sheep&rsquo;s kidneys, an onion cut into thin slices, half-a-dozen
        oysters, and some sliced potatoes. Sprinkle
        over these a little salt and pepper and a teaspoonful
        of curry powder. Then start again with cutlets, and
        keep on adding layers of the different ingredients until
        the dish be full. Whole potatoes atop of all, and
        pour in the oyster liquor and some good gravy.
        More gravy just before the dish is ready to serve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> Not too fierce an oven, just fierce enough to brown
        the top potatoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In making this succulent concoction you can
    add to, or substitute for, the mutton cutlets
    pretty nearly any sort of flesh or fowl. I have
    met rabbit, goose, larks, turkey, and (frequently)
    beef therein; but, believe me, the simple,
    harmless, necessary, toothsome cutlet makes the
    best lining.</p>
<p>In the Cape Colony, and even as high up as
    Rhodesia, I have met with a dish called a <i>Brady</i>,
    which is worthy of mention here. It is made in
    the same way as the familiar Irish stew; but
    instead of potatoes tomatoes are used.</p>

<p>There is no meal which has become more
    &ldquo;expanded&rdquo; than a shooting luncheon. A crust
    of bread with cheese, or a few biscuits, and a
    flask of sherry sufficed for our forebears, who, despite
    inferior weapons and ammunition, managed
    to &ldquo;bring &rsquo;em down&rdquo; quite as effectually as do
    the shootists of this period. Most certainly and
    decidedly, a heavy luncheon is a mistake if you
    want to &ldquo;shoot clean&rdquo; afterwards. And bear this
    in mind, all ye &ldquo;Johnnies&rdquo; who rail at your
    host&rsquo;s champagne and turtle, after luncheon, in a
    comfortable pavilion in the midst of a pheasant <i>battue</i>, and whose very beaters would turn up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> their noses at a pork pie and a glass of old ale,
    that there is nothing so good to shoot upon as
    cold tea, unless it be cold coffee. I have tried
    both, and for a shooting luncheon <i>par excellence</i> commend me to a crust and a pint of cold tea,
    eaten whilst sitting beneath the shelter of an
    unpleached hedge, against the formal spread which
    commences with a <i>consommé</i>, and finishes with
    guinea peaches, and liqueurs of rare curaçoa.
    Of course, it is assumed that the shooter wishes
    to make a bag.</p>
<p>But as, fortunately for trade, everybody does
    not share my views, it will be as well to append
    a few dishes suitable to a scratch meal of this sort.</p>
<p>First of all let it be said that a</p>
<h4><i>Roast Loin of Pork</i>,</h4>
<p>washed down with sweet champagne, is not
    altogether to be commended. I have nothing to
    urge against roast pork, on ordinary occasions, or
    champagne either; but a woodcock takes a lot of
    hitting.</p>
<p>Such a pudding as was sketched in the
    preceding chapter is allowable, as is also the
    Lancashire Hot-Pot.</p>
<h4><i>Shepherd&rsquo;s Pie</i>,</h4>
<p><i>i.e.</i> minced meat beneath a mattress of mashed
    potatoes, with lots of gravy in the dish, baked, is
    an economical dish, but a tasty one; and I have
    never known much left for the beaters. <span class="smcap">Rabbit
    Pie</span>, or Pudding, will stop a gap most effectually,
    and</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Plover Pudding</i></h4>
<p>&mdash;the very name brings water to the lips&mdash;is
    entitled to the highest commendation.</p>
<p>This is the favourite dish at the shooting
    luncheons of a well-known Royal Duke, and
    when upon one occasion the discovery was made
    that through some misunderstanding said pudding
    had been devoured to the very bones, by <i>the
    loaders</i>, the&mdash;well, &ldquo;the band played,&rdquo; as they
    say out West. And a stirring tune did that
    band play too.</p>
<h4><i>Such Larks!</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Stuff a dozen larks with a force-meat made from
        their own livers chopped, a little shallot, parsley,
        yolk of egg, salt, bread crumbs, and one green chili
        chopped and divided amongst the twelve. Brown in
        a stewpan, and then stew gently in a good gravy to
        which has been added a glass of burgundy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a <i>plât</i> fit for an emperor, and there will
    be no subsequent danger of his hitting a beater
    or a dog. Another dainty of home invention is</p>
<h4><i>Jugged Duck with Oysters</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Cut the fleshy parts of your waddler into neat
        joints, and having browned them place in a jar with
        nine oysters and some good gravy partly made from
        the giblets. Close the mouth of the jar, and stand
        it in boiling water for rather more than an hour.
        Add the strained liquor of the oysters and a little
        more gravy, and turn the concoction into a deep
        silver dish with a spirit lamp beneath. Wild duck
        can be jugged in the same way, but <i>without</i> the
        addition of the bivalves; and a mixture of port wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> and Worcester sauce should be poured in, with a
        squeeze of lemon juice and cayenne, just before
        serving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another dish which will be found &ldquo;grateful
    and comforting&rdquo; is an <i>old</i> grouse&mdash;the older the
    tastier. Stuff him with a Spanish onion, add a
    little gravy and seasoning, and stew him till the
    flesh leaves the bones. All these stews, or
    &ldquo;jugs&rdquo; should be served on dishes kept hot by
    lighted spirit beneath them. This is most
    important.</p>
<h4><i>A Woodcock Pie</i></h4>
<p>will be found extremely palatable at any shooting
    luncheon, although more frequently to be
    met with on the sideboards of the great and
    wealthy. In fact, at Christmas time, &rsquo;tis a pie
    which is specially concocted in the royal kitchen
    at Windsor Castle, to adorn Her Most Gracious
    Majesty&rsquo;s board at Osborne, together with the
    time-honoured baron of specially fed beef. This
    last named joint hardly meets my views as part
    of a breakfast <i>menu</i>; but here is the recipe for
    the woodcock pie.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Bone four woodcocks&mdash;I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> mean take them
        off the hooks when the gentleman is not in his shop,
        but tell your cook to take the bones out of one
        you&rsquo;ve shot yourself&mdash;put bones and trimmings into
        a saucepan with one shallot, one small onion, and a
        sprig of thyme, cover them with some good stock,
        and let this gravy simmer awhile. Take the gizzards
        away from the heart and liver, pound, and mix
        these with some good veal force-meat. Place the
        woodcocks, skin downwards, on a board; spread over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> each two layers of force-meat, with a layer of sliced
        truffles in between the two. Make your crust,
        either in a mould, or with the hands, put a layer of
        force-meat at the bottom, then two woodcocks, then
        a layer of truffles, then the other two woodcocks,
        another layer of truffles, and a top layer of force-meat,
        and some thin slices of fat bacon. Cover the
        pie, leaving a hole for the gravy, and bake in a
        moderate oven. After taking out pour in the
        gravy, then close the orifice and let the pie get cold
        before serving.</p>
    <p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;It will stimulate the <i>digging</i> industry if one
        or two <i>whole</i> truffles have been hidden away in the
        recesses of the pie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another good pie I have met with&mdash;in the
    north country&mdash;was lined with portions of
    grouse and black game (no bones), with here
    and there half a hard-boiled egg. Nothing else
    except the necessary seasoning.</p>
<p>With regard to</p>
<h4><i>Hunting Luncheons</i></h4>
<p>it cannot be said that your Nimrod is nearly as
    well catered for as is the &ldquo;Gun.&rdquo; For, as a
    rule, the first-named, if he be really keen on the
    sport of kings has to content himself, during the
    interval of a &ldquo;check,&rdquo; with the contents of a
    sandwich-case, and a flask, which may contain
    either brown sherry or brandy and water&mdash;or
    possibly something still more seductive. I have
    heard of flasks which held milk punch, but the
    experience is by no means a familiar one. If
    your Nimrod be given to &ldquo;macadamising,&rdquo;
    instead of riding the line, or if he sicken of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> business altogether before hounds throw off, he
    can usually &ldquo;cadge&rdquo; a lunch at some house in
    the neighbourhood, even though it may only
    &ldquo;run to&rdquo; bread and cheese&mdash;or, possibly, a
    wedge of a home-made pork-pie&mdash;with a glass,
    or mug, of nut brown ale. Not that all ale is
    &ldquo;nut brown,&rdquo; but &rsquo;tis an epithet which likes
    me well. Would it were possible to give practical
    hints here as to the true way to manufacture a
    pork-pie! To make the attempt would, I fear,
    only serve to invite disaster; for the art of
    pork-pie making, like that of the poet, or the
    play-actor, should be born within us. In large
    households in the midland counties (wherein
    doth flourish the pig tart) there is, as a rule, but
    one qualified pie-maker&mdash;who is incapable of any
    other culinary feat whatever. I have even been
    told that it requires &ldquo;special hands&rdquo; to make
    the crust of the proper consistency; and having
    tasted crusts <i>and</i> crusts, I can implicitly believe
    this statement. Here is a recipe for a veritable
    savoury</p>
<h4><i>Yorkshire Pie</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Bone a goose and a large fowl. Fill the latter
        with the following stuffing:&mdash;minced ham, veal,
        suet, onion, sweet herbs, lemon peel, mixed spices,
        goose-liver, cayenne, and salt, worked into a paste
        with the yolks of two eggs. Sew up the fowl, truss
        it, and stew it with the goose for twenty minutes in
        some good beef and giblet stock, with a small glass
        of sherry, in a close stewpan. Then put the fowl
        inside the goose, and place the goose within a pie-mould

        paste. Let the goose rest on a cushion of stuffing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> and in the middle of the liquor in which he has
        been stewed. Surround him in the pie with slices
        of parboiled tongue and chunks of semi-cooked
        pheasant, partridge, and hare, filling in the vacancies
        with more stuffing, put a layer of butter atop, roof
        in the pie with paste, bake for three hours, and eat
        either hot or cold&mdash;the latter for choice.</p>

<p>For a skating luncheon</p>
<h4><i>Irish Stew</i></h4>
<p>is the recognised <i>entrée</i>, served in soup-plates,
    and washed down with hot spiced ale.</p>
<p>In the way of</p>
<h4><i>Race-course Luncheons</i></h4>
<p>our caterers have made giant strides in the last
    dozen years. A member of a large firm once
    told me that it was &ldquo;out of the question&rdquo; to
    supply joints, chops, and steaks in the dining-rooms
    of a grand stand, distant far from his base
    of operations, London. &ldquo;Impossible, my dear
    sir! we couldn&rsquo;t do it without incurring a
    ruinous loss.&rdquo; But the whirligig of time has
    proved this feat to be not only possible, but one
    which has led to the best results for all concerned.
    In the matter of chops and steaks I hope to see
    further reforms introduced. These succulent
    dainties, it cannot be too widely known, are not
    at their best unless <i>cut fresh</i> from loin or rump,
    just before being placed on the gridiron. The
    longer a cut chop (raw) is kept the more of its
    virtue is lost. It might, possibly, cause a little
    extra delay, and a little extra expense, to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> off loins and rumps from the butcher&rsquo;s shop,
    instead of ready-cut portions, but the experiment
    would answer, in the long run. The same rule,
    of course, should apply to restaurants and grill-rooms
    all over the world.</p>
<p>During the autumn and winter months,
    race-course caterers seem to have but one
    idea of warm comforting food for their
    customers, and the name of that idea is Irish
    stew. This is no doubt an appetising dish,
    but might be varied occasionally for the
    benefit of the habitual follower of the sport
    of kings. Why not pea-soup, jugged hare
    (hares are cheap enough), hot-pot, Scotch broth,
    mullagatawny, hotch-potch, stewed or curried
    rabbit, with rice, shepherd&rsquo;s pie, haricot ox-tails,
    sheep&rsquo;s head broth (Scotch fashion), and hare
    soup! What is the matter with the world-renowned
    stew of which we read in <i>The Old
    Curiosity Shop</i>&mdash;the supper provided by the landlord
    of the &ldquo;Jolly Sandboys&rdquo; for the itinerant
    showmen? Here it is again:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a stew of tripe,&rsquo; said the landlord, smacking
        his lips, &lsquo;and cowheel,&rsquo; smacking them again,
        &lsquo;and bacon,&rsquo; smacking them once more, &lsquo;and
        steak,&rsquo; smacking them for the fourth time, &lsquo;and
        peas, cauliflowers, new potatoes, and sparrowgrass,
        all working up together in one delicious gravy.&rsquo;
        Having come to the climax, he smacked his lips a
        great many times, and taking a long hearty sniff of
        the fragrance that was hovering about, put on the
        cover again with the air of one whose toils on earth
        were over.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At what time will it be ready?&rsquo; asked Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> Codlin faintly. &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be done to a turn,&rsquo; said the
        landlord, looking up at the clock, &lsquo;at twenty-two
        minutes before eleven.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Mr. Codlin, &lsquo;fetch me a pint of
        warm ale, and don&rsquo;t let nobody bring into the room
        even so much as a biscuit till the time arrives.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I do vow and protest that the above
    passage has caused much more smacking of lips
    than the most expensive, savoury <i>menu</i> ever
    thought out. True, sparrowgrass and new
    potatoes, and any peas but dried or tinned ones
    are not as a rule at their best in the same season
    as tripe; but why not dried peas, and old potatoes,
    and rice, and curry powder, and onions&mdash;Charles
    Dickens forgot the onions&mdash;with, maybe, a
    modicum of old ale added, for &ldquo;body&rdquo;&mdash;in this
    stew, on a cold day at Sandown or Kempton? <i>Toujours</i> Irish stew, like <i>toujours</i> mother-in-law,
    is apt to pall upon the palate; especially if not
    fresh made. And frost occasionally interferes
    with the best-laid plans of a race-course caterer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind a postponed meeting,&rdquo; once
    observed one of the &ldquo;readiest&rdquo; of bookmakers;
    &ldquo;but what I cannot stand is postponed Irish stew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Than a good bowl of</p>
<h4><i>Scotch Broth</i>,</h4>
<p>what could be more grateful, or less expensive?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shin of beef, pearl barley, cabbages, leeks, turnips,
        carrots, dried peas (of course soaked overnight),
        and water&mdash;&ldquo;all working up together in one delicious
        gravy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Hotch Potch</i>.</h4>
<p>With the addition of cutlets from the best
    end of a neck of mutton, the same recipe as the
    above will serve for this dish, which it must be
    remembered should be more of a &ldquo;stodge&rdquo; than
    a broth.</p>
<p>There are more ways than one of making a
    &ldquo;hot-pot.&rdquo; The recipe given above would hardly
    suit the views of any caterer who wishes to make
    a living for himself; but it can be done on the
    cheap. The old lady whose dying husband was
    ordered by the doctor oysters and champagne,
    procured whelks and ginger beer for the patient,
    instead, on the score of economy. Then why
    not make your hot-pot with mussels instead of
    oysters? Or why add any sort of mollusc? In
    the certain knowledge that these be invaluable
    hints to race-course caterers, I offer them with all
    consideration and respect.</p>
<p>The writer well remembers the time when the
    refreshments on Newmarket Heath at race-time
    were dispensed from a booth, which stood almost
    adjoining the &ldquo;Birdcage.&rdquo; Said refreshments
    were rough, but satisfying, and consisted of thick
    sandwiches, cheese, and bread, with &ldquo;thumb-pieces&rdquo;
    (or &ldquo;thumbers&rdquo;) of beef, mutton, and
    pork, which the luncher was privileged to cut
    with his own clasp-knife. Said &ldquo;thumbers&rdquo;
    seem to have gone out of favour with the
    aristocracy of the Turf; but the true racing
    or coursing sandwich still forms part of the <i>impedimenta</i> of many a cash-bookmaker, of his
    clerk, and of many a &ldquo;little&rdquo; backer. &rsquo;Tis a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> solid, satisfying sandwich, and is just the sort
    of nourishment for a hard worker on a bitter
    November day. Let your steak be grilling,
    whilst you are enjoying your breakfast&mdash;some
    prefer the ox-portion fried, for these simple
    speculators have strange tastes&mdash;then take the
    steak off the fire and place it, all hot, between
    two <i>thick</i> slices of bread. The sandwich will
    require several paper wrappings, if you value the
    purity of your pocket-linings. And when eaten
    cold, the juices of the meat will be found to
    have irrigated the bread, with more or less
    &ldquo;delicious gravy.&rdquo; And, as Sam Weller ought
    to have said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the gravy as does it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the swells?&rdquo; I fancy I
    hear somebody asking, &ldquo;Is my Lord Tomnoddy,
    or the Duke of Earlswood to be compelled to
    satisfy his hunger, on a race-course, with tripe
    and fat bacon? Are you really advising those
    dapper-looking, tailor-made ladies on yonder drag
    to insert their delicate teeth in a sandwich which
    would have puzzled Gargantua to masticate?&rdquo;
    Not at all, my good sir, or madam. The well-appointed
    coach should be well-appointed within
    and without. Of course the luncheon it contains
    will differ materially according to the season of
    the year. This is the sort of meal I will provide,
    an you will deign to visit the Arabian tent
    behind my coach, at Ascot:</p>
<p>Lobster mayonnaise, salmon cutlets with
    Tartar sauce (<i>iced</i>), curried prawns (<i>iced</i>), lobster
    cutlets, <i>chaud-froid</i> of quails, <i>foie gras</i> in aspic,
    prawns in ditto, plovers&rsquo; eggs in ditto, galantine
    of chicken, York ham, sweets various, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> iced gooseberry fool; and, as the <i>pièce de résistance</i>,
    an</p>
<h4><i>Angel&rsquo;s Pie</i>.</h4>
<p>Many people would call this a pigeon pie, for in
    good sooth there be pigeons in it; but &rsquo;tis a pie
    worthy of a brighter sphere than this.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Six plump young pigeons, trimmed of all superfluous
        matter, including pinions and below the
        thighs. Season with pepper and salt, and stuff these
        pigeons with <i>foie gras</i>, and quartered truffles, and
        fill up the pie with plovers&rsquo; eggs and some good
        force-meat. Make a good gravy from the superfluous
        parts of the birds, and some calf&rsquo;s head stock
        to which has been added about half a wine-glassful
        of old Madeira, with some lemon-juice and cayenne.
        See that your paste be light and flaky, and bake in
        a moderate oven for three hours. Pour in more
        gravy just before taking out, and let the pie get
        cold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a concoction which will make you
    back all the winners; whilst no heiress who
    nibbles at it would refuse you her hand and
    heart afterwards.</p>
<p>This is another sort of</p>
<h4><i>Pigeon Pie</i></h4>
<p>which is best served hot, and is more suited to
    the dining-room than the race-course.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Line a pie dish with veal force-meat, very highly
        seasoned, about an inch thick. Place on it some
        thin slices of fat bacon, three Bordeaux pigeons
        (trimmed) in halves, a veal sweetbread in slices, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> ox palate, boiled and cut up into dice, a dozen
        asparagus tops, a few button mushrooms (the large
        ones would give the interior of the pie a bad colour)
        and the yolks of four eggs. Cover with force-meat,
        and bake for three hours. Some good veal gravy
        should be served with this, which I have named</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Suffolk Pride</i>.</h4>
<p>It is a remarkable fact in natural history that
    English pigeons are at their best just at the
    time when the young rooks leave the shelter of
    their nests. Therefore have I written, in the
    above recipe, &ldquo;Bordeaux&rdquo; pigeons.</p>
<p>Here is a quaint old eighteenth-century recipe,
    which comes from Northumberland, and is given <i>verbatim</i>, for a</p>
<h4><i>Goose Pie</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Bone a goose, a turkey, a hare, and a brace of
        grouse; skin it, and cut off all the outside pieces&mdash;I
        mean of the <i>tongue</i>, after boiling it&mdash;lay the goose,
        for the outside a few pieces of hare; then lay in the
        turkey, the grouse, and the remainder of the tongue
        and hare. Season highly between each layer with
        pepper and salt, mace and cayenne, and put it
        together, and draw it close with a needle and thread.
        Take 20 lbs. of flour, put 5 lbs. of butter into a
        pan with some water, let it boil, pour it among the
        flour, stir it with a knife, then work it with your
        hands till quite stiff. Let it stand before the fire
        for half an hour, then raise your pie and set it to
        cool; then finish it, put in the meat, close the pie,
        and set it in a cold place. Ornament according
        to your taste, bandage it with calico dipped in fat.
        Let it stand all night before baking. It will take a
        long time to bake. The oven must be pretty hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> for the first four hours, and then allowed to slacken.
        To know when it is enough, raise one of the ornaments,
        and with a fork try if the meat is tender.
        If it is hard the pie must be put in again for two
        hours more. After it comes out of the oven fill up
        with strong stock, well seasoned, or with clarified
        butter. All standing pies made in this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Verily, in the eighteenth century they must
    have had considerably more surplus cash and
    time, and rather more angelic cooks than their
    descendants!</p>
<p>During cold weather the interior of the coach
    should be well filled with earthenware vessels
    containing such provender as hot-pot, hare soup,
    mullagatawny, lobster <i>à l&rsquo;Américaine</i>, curried
    rabbit, devilled larks&mdash;with the <i>matériel</i> for heating
    these. Such cold viands as game pie, pressed
    beef, boar&rsquo;s head, <i>foie gras</i> (truffled), plain truffles
    (to be steamed and served with buttered toast)
    anchovies, etc. The larks should be smothered
    with a paste made from a mixture of mustard,
    Chili vinegar, and a little anchovy paste, and kept
    closely covered up. After heating, add cayenne
    to taste.</p>
<p>Gourmets interested in <i>menus</i> may like to
    know what were the first <i>déjeuners</i> partaken of by
    the Tsar on his arrival in Paris in October 1869.</p>
<p>On the first day he had huîtres, consommé,
    &#339;ufs à la Parisienne, filet de b&#339;uf, pommes de
    terre, Nesselrode sauce, chocolat.</p>
<p>Next day he ate huîtres, consommé, &#339;ufs
    Dauphine, rougets, noisettes d&rsquo;agneau maréchal,
    pommes de terre, cailles à la Bohémienne,
    poires Bar-le-Duc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>The writer can recall some colossal luncheons
    partaken of at dear, naughty Simla, in the long
    ago, when a hill station in India was, if anything,
    livelier than at the present day, and furnished plenty
    of food for both mind and body. Our host was
    the genial proprietor of a weekly journal, to
    which most of his guests contributed, after their
    lights; &ldquo;sport and the drama&rdquo; falling to the
    present writer&rsquo;s share. Most of the food at
    those luncheons had been specially imported from
    Europe; and although the whitebait tasted more
    of the hermetical sealing than of the Thames
    mud, most of the other items were succulent
    enough. There were turtle soup, and turtle fins;
    highly seasoned <i>pâtés</i> of sorts; and the native <i>khansamah</i> had added several dishes of his own
    providing and invention. A young florican
    (bustard) is by no means a bad bird, well roasted
    and basted; and though the eternal <i>vilolif</i> (veal
    olives) were usually sent away untasted, his snipe
    puddings were excellent. What was called <i>picheese</i> (twenty-five years old) brandy, from the <i>atelier</i> of Messrs. Justerini and Brooks, was served
    after the coffee; and those luncheon parties seldom
    broke up until it was time to dress for dinner.
    In fact, our memories were not often keen as
    to anything which occurred after the coffee,
    and many &ldquo;strange things happened&rdquo; in consequence;
    although as they have no particular
    connection with high-class cookery, they need
    not be alluded to in this chapter.</p>
<p>But, as observed before, I am of opinion that
    luncheon, except under certain circumstances, is
    a mistake.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It is somewhat humiliating to reflect that we
    Britons owe the art of dining to our first conquerors
    the Romans&mdash;a smooth-faced race of
    voluptuaries whose idea of a <i>bonne bouche</i> took
    the form of a dormouse stewed in honey and
    sprinkled with poppy-seed. But it was not
    until the Normans had fairly established themselves
    and their cookery, that the sturdy Saxon
    submitted himself to be educated by the foreign
    food-spoiler; and at a later period the frequent
    invasions of France by Britain&mdash;when money
    was &ldquo;tight&rdquo; in the little island&mdash;were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> undoubtedly responsible for the commencement
    of the system of &ldquo;decorating&rdquo; food which so
    largely obtains to-day.</p>
<p>The name &ldquo;dinner&rdquo; is said&mdash;although it
    seems incredible that words should have become
    so corrupted&mdash;to be a corruption of <i>dix heures</i>,
    the time at which (<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>), in the old Norman
    days, the meal was usually partaken of; and the
    time at which (<span class="smcap">P.M.</span>), in later years, when none of
    the guests ever knew the hour, in that loose-and-careless
    period, the meal was occasionally partaken
    of at Limmer&rsquo;s and at Lane&rsquo;s, in London
    town. Froissart, in one of his works, mentions
    having waited upon the Duke of Lancaster at
    5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, &ldquo;after his Grace had supped&rdquo;; and it is
    certain that during the reigns of Francis I. and
    Louis XII. of France, the world of fashion was
    accustomed to dine long before the sun had
    arrived at the meridian, and to sup at what we
    now call &ldquo;afternoon tea time.&rdquo; Louis XIV.
    did not dine till twelve; and his contemporaries,
    Oliver Cromwell and the Merry Monarch, sat
    down to the principal meal at one. In 1700,
    two was the fashionable time; and in 1751 we
    read that the Duchess of Somerset&rsquo;s hour for
    dinner was three. The hour for putting the
    soup on the table kept on advancing, until, after
    Waterloo, it became almost a penal offence to
    dine before six; and so to the end of the century,
    when we sit down to a sumptuous repast at a
    time when farm-labourers and artisans are either
    snug between the blankets, or engaged in their
    final wrangle at the &ldquo;Blue Pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Romans in the time of Cicero had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> light breakfast at 3.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, lunched at noon,
    and attacked the <i>c&#339;na</i> at periods varying between
    3 and 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;according to the season of the
    year. They commenced the first course with
    eggs, and each noble Roman was supposed to
    clear his palate with an apple at the conclusion
    of the third course. &ldquo;A banquet with Vitellius,&rdquo;
    we read, &ldquo;was no light and simple repast.
    Leagues of sea and miles of forest had been swept
    to furnish the mere groundwork of the entertainment.
    Hardy fishermen had spent their nights
    on the heaving wave, that the giant turbot might
    flap its snowy flakes on the Emperor&rsquo;s table,
    broader than its broad dish of gold. Many a
    swelling hill, clad in the dark oak coppice, had
    echoed to ringing shout of hunter and deep-mouthed
    bay of hound, ere the wild boar yielded
    his grim life, by the morass, and the dark grisly
    carcase was drawn off to provide a standing dish
    that was only meant to gratify the eye. Even
    the peacock roasted in its feathers was too gross
    a dainty&rdquo;&mdash;especially the feather part, we should
    think&mdash;&ldquo;for epicures who studied the art of gastronomy
    under Caesar; and that taste would have
    been considered rustic in the extreme which
    could partake of more than the mere fumes and
    savour of so substantial a dish. A thousand
    nightingales had been trapped and killed, indeed,
    for this one supper, but brains and tongues were
    all they contributed to the banquet; while even
    the wing of a roasted hare would have been
    considered far too coarse and common food for
    the imperial table.&rdquo; Talk about a bean-feast!</p>
<p>According to Suetonius (whose name suggests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> &ldquo;duff&rdquo;) the villain Nero was accustomed to dine
    in a superb apartment, surrounded with mechanical
    scenery, which could be &ldquo;shifted&rdquo; with
    every course. The suppers of &ldquo;Vitellius the
    Glutton&rdquo; cost, on the average, more than £4000
    a-piece&mdash;which reads like a &ldquo;Kaffir Circus&rdquo;
    dinner at the Savoy&mdash;and the celebrated feast to
    which he invited his brother was down in the
    bill for £40,350. Now a-nights we don&rsquo;t spend
    as much on a dinner, even when we invite other
    people&rsquo;s wives. &ldquo;It consisted&rdquo;&mdash;I always think
    of Little Dombey and the dinner at Doctor
    Blimber&rsquo;s, on reading these facts&mdash;&ldquo;of two
    thousand different dishes of fish, and seven
    thousand of fowls, with other equally numerous
    meats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharp-biting salads,&rdquo; salted herrings, and
    pickled anchovies, were served, as <i>hors d&rsquo;&#339;uvres</i> during the first course of a Roman banquet, to
    stimulate the hunger which the rest of the meal
    would satisfy; but although Vitellius was,
    according to history, &ldquo;a whale on&rdquo; oysters, they
    do not appear to have been eaten as a whet to
    appetite. And it was the duty of one, or more,
    of the Emperor&rsquo;s &ldquo;freedmen&rdquo; to taste every dish
    before his imperial master, in case poison might
    lurk therein. A garland of flowers around the
    brows was the regular wear for a guest at a
    &ldquo;swagger&rdquo; dinner party in ancient Rome, and,
    the eating part over, said garland was usually
    tilted back on the head, the while he who had
    dined disposed himself in an easy attitude on his
    ivory couch, and proffered his cup to be filled
    by the solicitous slave. Then commenced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> &ldquo;big drink.&rdquo; But it must be remembered that
    although the subsequent display of fireworks was
    provided from lively Early Christians, in tar
    overcoats, these Romans drank the pure, unadulterated
    juice of the grape, freely mixed with
    water; so that headaches i&rsquo; th&rsquo; morn were not <i>de rigueur</i>, nor did the subsequent massacres and
    other diversions in the Amphitheatre cause any
    feelings of &ldquo;jumpiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Roman bill-of-fare, however, does not
    commend itself to all British epicures, one of
    whom wrote, in a convivial song&mdash;</p>

<p>My pen loves to linger long over the gastronomies
    of those shaven voluptuaries, the ancient
    Italians; and my Caledonian readers will forgive
    the old tales when it is further set forth that the
    Romans introduced, amongst other things,</p>
<h4><i>Haggis</i></h4>
<p>into Bonnie Scotland. Yes, the poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;great
    chieftain o&rsquo; the puddin&rsquo; race&rdquo; is but an Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> dish after all. The Apician pork haggis<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was a
    boiled pig&rsquo;s stomach filled with fry and brains,
    raw eggs, and pine-apples beaten to a pulp, and
    seasoned with <i>liquamen</i>. For although some of
    the Romans&rsquo; tastes savoured of refinement, many
    of them were &ldquo;absolutely beastly.&rdquo; The idea of
    pig&rsquo;s fry and pine-apples mixed is horrible enough;
    but take a look into the constitution of this <i>liquamen</i>, and wonder no longer that Gibbons
    wrote his <i>Decline and Fall</i> with so much feeling
    and <i>gusto</i>. This sauce was obtained from the
    intestines, gills, and blood of fishes, great and
    small, stirred together with salt, and exposed in
    an open vat in the sun, until the compound
    became putrid. When putrefaction had done
    its work, wine and spices were added to the
    hell-broth, which was subsequently strained and
    sent into the Roman market. This <i>liquamen</i> was manufactured in Greece, and not one of all
    the poets of sunny Italy seems to have satirised
    the &ldquo;made-in-Greece&rdquo; custom, which in those
    days must have been almost as obnoxious as the
    &ldquo;made-in-Germany&rdquo; or the &ldquo;made-in-Whitechapel&rdquo;
    scare of to-day.</p>
<p>The usual farinaceous ingredient of the
    Roman haggis was frumenty, but frequently
    no grain whatever was applied; and instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> of mincing the ingredients, as do the Scots,
    the ancients pounded them in a mortar, well
    moistened with <i>liquamen</i>, until reduced to pulp.
    We are further told in history that a Roman
    gladiator was capable, after playing with eggs,
    fish, nightingales&rsquo; tongues, dormice, and haggis,
    of finishing a wild boar at a sitting. But as
    the old lady remarked of the great tragedy, this
    happened a long time ago, so let&rsquo;s hope it isn&rsquo;t
    true.</p>
<p>The Saxon dining-table was oblong, and
    rounded at the ends. The cloth was crimson,
    with broad gilt edgings hanging low beneath
    the table, and, it is to be feared, often soiled by
    the dirty boots of the guests, who sat on chairs
    with covered backs, the counterfeit presentments
    of which are still to be seen in the Tottenham
    Court Road. The food consisted of fish, fowls,
    beef, mutton, venison, and pork&mdash;wild and
    domestic&mdash;either boiled, baked, or broiled, and
    handed to the company by the attendants on
    small <i>sples</i>. A favourite &ldquo;fish joint&rdquo; of the old
    Saxon was a cut out of the middle of a porpoise;
    and bread of the finest wheaten flour reposed in
    two silver baskets at each end of the table, above
    the salt, the retainers having to content themselves
    with coarser &ldquo;household&rdquo; out of a wooden
    cradle. Almost the only vegetable in use amongst
    the Saxons was colewort, although the Romans
    had brought over many others, years before;
    but hatred of anything foreign was more
    rampant in early Saxon days than at present.
    Forks were not introduced into England until
    during the reign of King &ldquo;Jamie&rdquo;: so that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> ancestors had perforce to &ldquo;thumb&rdquo; their victuals.
    The fair Queen Elizabeth (like much more
    modern monarchs) was accustomed to raise to
    her mouth with her virgin fingers a turkey leg
    and gnaw it. But even in the earliest days of
    the thirteenth century, each person was provided
    with a small silver basin and two flowered napkins
    of the finest linen, for finger-washing and wiping
    purposes. Grapes, figs, nuts, apples, pears, and
    almonds, constituted a Saxon dessert; and in
    the reign of Edward III. an Act of Parliament
    was passed, forbidding any man or woman to
    be served with more than two courses, unless on
    high days and holidays, when each was entitled
    to three.</p>
<p>Here is the bill for the ingredients of a big dinner
    provided by a City Company in the fifteenth
    century: &ldquo;Two loins of veal and two loins of
    mutton, 1s. 4d.; one loin of beef, 4d.; one dozen
    pigeons and 12 rabbits, 9d.; one pig and one
    capon, 1s.; one goose and 100 eggs, 1s. 0½d.;
    one leg of mutton, 2½d.; two gallons of sack,
    1s. 4d.; eight gallons of strong ale, 1s. 6d.;
    total, 7s. 6d.&rdquo; Alas! In these advanced days
    the goose alone would cost more than the
    &ldquo;demmed total.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cedric the Saxon&rsquo;s dining table, described in <i>Ivanhoe</i>, was of a much simpler description than
    the one noted above; and the fare also. But
    there was no lack of assorted liquors&mdash;old wine
    and ale, good mead and cider, rich morat (a mixture
    of honey and mulberry juice, a somewhat gouty
    beverage, probably), and odoriferous pigment&mdash;which
    was composed of highly-spiced wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> sweetened with honey. The Virgin Queen, at
    a later epoch, was catered for more delicately;
    and we read that she detested all coarse meats,
    evil smells, and strong wines. During the
    Georgian era coarse meats and strong wines
    were by no means out of favour; and Highland
    banquets especially were Gargantuan feasts, to
    be read of with awe. The dinner given by
    Fergus MacIvor, in honour of Captain Waverley,
    consisted of dishes of fish and game, carefully
    dressed, at the upper end of the table, immediately
    under the eye of the English stranger. &ldquo;Lower
    down stood immense clumsy joints of beef,&rdquo; says
    the gifted author, &ldquo;which, but for the absence
    of pork, abhorred in the Highlands, resembled
    the rude festivity of the banquet of Penelope&rsquo;s
    suitors. But the central dish was a yearling lamb,
    called a &ldquo;hog in har&rsquo;st,&rdquo; roasted whole. It was
    set upon its legs, with a bunch of parsley in its
    mouth, and was probably exhibited in that form
    to gratify the pride of the cook, who piqued
    himself more on the plenty than the elegance
    of his master&rsquo;s table. The sides of this poor
    animal&rdquo;&mdash;the lamb, not the cook, we suppose is
    meant&mdash;&ldquo;were fiercely attacked by the clansmen,
    some with dirks, others with the knives worn in
    the same sheath as the dagger, so that it was
    soon rendered a mangled and rueful spectacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spectacle which reminds the writer of a
    dinner table at the Royal Military College,
    Sandhurst, in the early sixties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower down,&rdquo; continues Sir Walter, &ldquo;the
    victuals seemed of yet coarser quality, though
    sufficiently abundant. Broth, onions, cheese, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> the fragments of the feast, regaled the sons of
    Ivor, who feasted in the open air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The funeral baked meats used after the interment
    of the chief of the Clan Quhele (described
    in <i>The Fair Maid of Perth</i>) were also on a very
    extensive scale, and were, like the other meal,
    &ldquo;digested&rdquo; with pailfuls of usquebaugh, for
    which no Highland head that supported a bonnet
    was ever &ldquo;the waur i&rsquo; th&rsquo; morn.&rdquo; And the
    custom of placing bagpipers behind the chairs
    of the guests, after they have well drunk,
    which is still observed in Highland regiments,
    was probably introduced by the aforesaid
    Fergus MacIvor, who really ought to have
    known better.</p>
<p>And so the years rolled on; and at the commencement
    of the nineteenth century, old England,
    instead of enjoying the blessings of universal
    peace, such as the spread of the Gospel of Christianity
    might have taught us to expect, found
    herself involved in rather more warfare than
    was good for trade, or anything else. The first
    &ldquo;innings&rdquo; of the Corsican usurper was a short
    but merry one; the second saw him finally
    &ldquo;stumped.&rdquo; And from that period dates the
    &ldquo;avenging of Waterloo&rdquo; which we have suffered
    in silence for so long. The immigration of
    aliens commenced, and in the tight little island
    were deposited a large assortment of the poisonous
    seeds of alien cookery which had never
    exactly flourished before. The combat between
    the Roast Beef of old England and the bad fairy
    &ldquo;<i>Ala</i>,&rdquo; with her attendant sprites Grease, Vinegar,
    and Garlic, commenced; a combat which at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> end of the nineteenth century looked excessively
    like terminating in favour of the fairy.</p>
<p>It has been repeatedly urged against my former
    gastronomic writings that they are unjustly
    severe on French cookery; that far greater
    minds than mine own have expressed unqualified
    approval thereof; that I know absolutely nothing
    about the subject; and that my avowed hatred
    of our lively neighbours and their works is so
    ferocious as to become ridiculous. These statements
    are not altogether fair to myself. I have
    no &ldquo;avowed hatred&rdquo; of our lively neighbours;
    in fact, upon one occasion on returning from the
    celebration of the Grand Prix, I saw a vision of&mdash;&mdash;but
    that is a different anecdote. My lash
    has never embraced the entire <i>batterie de cuisine</i> of the <i>chef</i>, and there be many French <i>plats</i> which are agreeable to the palate, as long as we
    are satisfied that the <i>matériel</i> of which they are
    composed is sound, wholesome, and of the best
    quality. It is the cheap <i>restaurateur</i> who should
    be improved out of England. I was years ago
    inveigled into visiting the kitchen of one of these
    grease-and-garlic shops, and&mdash;&mdash;but the memory
    is too terrible for language. And will anybody
    advance the statement that a basin of the <i>tortue
    claire</i> of the average <i>chef</i> deserves to be mentioned
    in the same breath with a plate of clear turtle at
    Birch&rsquo;s or Painter&rsquo;s? or that good genuine
    English soup, whether ox-tail, mock-turtle, pea,
    oyster, or Palestine, is not to be preferred to the
    French <i>purée</i>, or to their teakettle broth flavoured
    with carrots, cabbages, and onions, and dignified
    by the name of <i>consommé</i>?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>Then let us tackle the subject of fish. Would
    you treat a salmon in the British way, or smother
    him with thick brown gravy, fried onions, garlic,
    mushrooms, inferior claret, oysters, sugar, pepper,
    salt, and nutmeg, <i>en Matelote</i>, or mince him fine
    to make a ridiculous <i>mousse</i>? Similarly with the
    honest, manly sole; would you fry or grill him
    plain, or bake him in a coat of rich white sauce,
    onion juice, mussel ditto, and white wine, or
    cider, <i>à la Normande</i>; or cover him with toasted
    cheese <i>à la Cardinal</i>?</p>
<p>The fairy &ldquo;<i>Ala</i>&rdquo; is likewise responsible for
    the clothing of purely English food in French
    disguises. Thus a leg of mutton becomes a <i>gigot</i>, a pheasant (for its transgressions in
    eating the poor farmer&rsquo;s barley) a <i>faisan</i>, and is
    charged for at special rates in the bill; whilst
    the nearest to a beef-steak our lively neighbours
    can get is a portion of beef with the fibre
    smashed by a wooden mallet, surmounted by an
    exceedingly bilious-looking compound like axle-grease,
    and called a <i>Châteaubriand</i>; and curry
    becomes under the new <i>régime</i>, <i>kari</i>.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the principal reason for serving
    food smothered in made-gravies lies in the inferiority
    of the food. Few judges will credit
    France with the possession of better butcher&rsquo;s-meat&mdash;with
    the exception of veal&mdash;than the
    perfidious island, which is so near in the matter
    of distance, and yet so far in the matter of
    custom. And it is an established fact that the
    fish of Paris is not as fresh as the fish of London.
    Hence the <i>sole Normande</i>, the <i>sole au gratin</i>,
    and the sole smothered in toasted cheese. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> when we islanders are charged at least four times
    as much for the inferior article, in its foreign
    cloak, as for the home article in its native
    majesty, I think the time has come to protest.
    It is possible to get an excellent dinner at any
    of the &ldquo;Gordon&rdquo; hotels, at the &ldquo;Savoy,&rdquo; the
    &ldquo;Cecil,&rdquo; and at some other noted food-houses&mdash;more
    especially at Romano&rsquo;s&mdash;by paying a stiff
    price for it; but it is due to a shameful lack of
    enterprise on the part of English caterers that a
    well-cooked English dinner is becoming more
    difficult to procure, year after year. There be
    three purely British dishes which are always &ldquo;hoff&rdquo;
    before all others on the programme of club, hotel,
    or eating-house; and these are, Irish stew, liver-and-bacon,
    and tripe-and-onions. Yet hardly a
    week passes without a new <i>dîner Parisien</i> making its appearance in the advertisement
    columns of the newspapers; whilst the cheap-and-nasty <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i>, with its six or seven
    courses and its Spanish claret, has simply throttled
    the Roast Beef of Old England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, after examining a
    French <i>menu</i>, &ldquo;my brain is obfuscated after the
    perusal of this heterogeneous conglomeration of
    bastard English ill-spelt, and a foreign tongue.
    I prithee bid thy knaves bring me a dish of
    hog&rsquo;s puddings, a slice or two from the upper
    cut of a well-roasted sirloin, and two apple-dumplings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; said George Augustus Sala to
    the old waiter at the &ldquo;Cheshire Cheese,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    had nothing fit to eat for three months; get me
    a point steak, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>The great lauder of foreign cookery had only
    that day returned from a special mission to France,
    to &ldquo;write up&rdquo; the works of the <i>cordon bleu</i> for
    the benefit of us benighted Englishmen. No
    man in the wide wide world knew so much, or
    could write so much, on the subject of and in
    praise of the fairy &ldquo;<i>Ala</i>,&rdquo; as George Sala; and
    probably no man in the wide wide world so little
    appreciated her efforts.</p>
<p>But how has it come about that the fairy
    &ldquo;<i>Ala</i>&rdquo; has gained such headway in this island of
    ours? The answer must commence another
    chapter.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Imitation&mdash;Dear Lady Thistlebrain&mdash;Try it on the dog&mdash;Criminality
        of the English Caterer&mdash;The stove, the stink,
        the steamer&mdash;Roasting <i>v.</i> Baking&mdash;False Economy&mdash;Dirty
        ovens&mdash;Frills and fingers&mdash;Time over Dinner&mdash;A long-winded
        Bishop&mdash;Corned beef.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now for the cause, alluded to at the end of the
    last chapter.</p>
<p><i>Imprimis</i>, the French invasion is due to the
    universal craze for imitation, which may be the
    sincerest form of flattery, but which frequently
    leads to bad results. For years past the fair sex
    of Great Britain have been looking to Paris for
    fashion in dress, as well as in cookery; whilst
    the other sex have long held the mistaken notion
    that &ldquo;they manage things better in France.&rdquo;
    The idea that France is the only country capable
    of clothing the outer and the inner man,
    artistically, has taken deep root. Thus, if the
    Duchess of Dulverton import, regardless of
    expense, a divine creation in bonnets from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> Rue de Castiglione, and air the same in church,
    it is good odds that little Mrs. Stokes, of the
    Talbot Road, Bayswater, will have had the <i>chapeau</i> copied, at about one-twentieth of the
    original cost, by the next Sabbath day. Dear
    Lady Thistlebrain, who has <i>such</i> taste (since she
    quitted the family mangle in Little Toke Street,
    Lambeth, for two mansions, a castle, and a deer
    park), and with whom money is no object, pays
    her <i>chef</i> the wages of an ambassador, and everybody
    raves over her dinners. Mrs. Potter of
    Maida Vale sets her &ldquo;gal&rdquo; (who studied higher
    gastronomy, together with the piano, and flower-painting
    on satin, at the Board School) to work
    on similar <i>menus</i>&mdash;with, on the whole, disastrous
    results. The London society and fashion journals
    encourage this snobbish idea by quoting <i>menus</i>,
    most of them ridiculous. Amongst the middle
    classes the custom of giving dinner parties at
    hotels has for some time past been spreading, partly
    to save trouble, and partly to save the brain of the
    domestic cook; so that instead of sitting down to
    a plain dinner, with, maybe, an <i>entrée</i> or two sent
    in by the local confectioner&mdash;around the family
    mahogany tree, all may be fanciful decoration,
    and not half enough to eat, electric light, and <i>à la</i> with attendance charged in the bill.</p>
<p>The only way to stop this sort of thing is to
    bring the system into ridicule, to try it on the
    groundlings. A fair leader of <i>ton</i>, late in the
    sixties, appeared one morning in the haunts of
    fashion, her shapely shoulders covered with a cape
    of finest Russian sables, to the general admiration
    and envy of all her compeers. Thereupon, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> did her dearest friend and (of course) most deadly
    rival do? Get a similar cape, or one of finer
    quality? Not a bit of it. She drove off, then and
    there, to her furriers, and had her coachman and
    footman fitted with similar capes, in (of course)
    cheaper material; and, when next afternoon she
    took the air in the park, in her perfectly appointed
    landau, her fur-clad menials created something
    like a panic in the camp of her enemy, whilst fur
    capes for fair leaders of &ldquo;<i>ton</i>,&rdquo; were, like hashed
    venison at a City luncheon, very soon &ldquo;hoff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is extremely probable that, could it be
    arranged to feed our starving poor, beneath the
    public gaze, on <i>sôles Normandes</i>, <i>côtelettes à la
    Reform</i>, and <i>salmi de gibier truffé</i>; to feast our
    workhouse children on <i>bisque d&rsquo;écrévisses</i> and <i>Ananas à la Créole</i>, the upper classes of Great
    Britain would soon revert to plain roast and
    boiled.</p>
<p>But after all it is the English caterer who is
    chiefly to blame for his own undoing. How is
    it that in what may be called the &ldquo;food streets&rdquo;
    of the metropolis the foreign food-supplier should
    outnumber the purveyor of the Roast Beef of Old
    England in the proportion of fifty to one?
    Simply because the Roast Beef of Old England
    has become almost as extinct as the Dodo. There
    are but few English kitchens, at this end of the
    nineteenth century, in the which meat is roasted
    in front of the fire.</p>
<p>In order to save the cost of fuel, most English
    (save the mark!) cooking is now performed by
    gas or steam; and at many large establishments
    the food, whether fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> pastry, all goes, in a raw state, into a species of
    chest of drawers made of block-tin, in which
    receptacle the daily luncheons, dinners, and
    suppers are steamed and robbed of all flavour,
    save that of hot tin. The pity of it! Better,
    far better for mankind the <i>à la</i> system than
    to be gradually &ldquo;steamed&rdquo; into the tomb!</p>
<p>It is alleged that as good results in the way of
    roasting can be got from an oven as from the
    spit. But that oven must be ventilated&mdash;with
    both an inlet and an outlet ventilator, for one
    will not act without the other. It is also
    advisable that said oven should be cleaned out
    occasionally; for a hot oven with no joint therein
    will emit odours anything but agreeable, if not
    attended to; and it is not too sweeping a statement
    to say that the majority of ovens in busy
    kitchens are foul. The system of steaming food
    (the alleged &ldquo;roasts&rdquo; being subsequently browned
    in an oven) is of comparatively recent date; but
    the oven as a roaster was the invention of one
    Count Rumford, at the beginning of the nineteenth
    century. In one of his lectures on oven-roasting,
    this nobleman remarked that he despaired
    of getting any Englishman to believe his words;
    so that he was evidently confronted with plenty
    of prejudice, which it is devoutly to be prayed
    still exists in English homes. For I do vow and
    protest that the oven odours which pervade the
    neighbourhood of the Strand, London, at midday,
    are by no means calculated to whet the appetite
    of the would-be luncher or diner. This is what
    such an authority as Mr. Buckmaster wrote on
    the subject of the spit <i>versus</i> the oven:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;I believe I am regarded as a sort of heretic on the
        question of roasting meat. My opinion is that the
        essential condition of good roasting is constant basting,
        and this the meat is not likely to have when shut
        up in an iron box; and what is not easily done is
        easily neglected.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this connection there are more heretics
    than Mr. Buckmaster. But if during my lifetime
    the days of burning heretics should be
    revived, I shall certainly move the Court of
    Criminal Appeal in favour of being roasted or
    grilled before, or over, the fire, instead of being
    deprived of my natural juices in an iron box.</p>
<p>Some few &ldquo;roast&rdquo; houses are still in existence
    in London, but they be few and far between;
    and since Mr. Cooper gave up the &ldquo;Albion,&rdquo;
    nearly opposite the stage-door of Drury Lane
    Theatre, the lover of good, wholesome, English
    food has lost one old-fashioned tavern in the
    which he was certain of enjoying such food.</p>
<p>It has been repeatedly urged in favour of
    French cookery that it is so economical. But
    economy in the preparation of food is by no
    means an unmixed blessing. I do not believe
    that much sole-leather is used up in the ordinary <i>ragoût</i>, or <i>salmi</i>; but many of us who can afford
    more expensive joints have a prejudice against
    &ldquo;scrags&rdquo;; whilst the tails of mutton chops
    frequently have a tainted flavour, and the drumsticks
    and backs of fowls are only fit to grill, or
    boil down into gravy. And it is not only the
    alien who is economical in his preparation of the
    banquet. Many of the dwellers in the highways
    and bye-ways of our great metropolis will boil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> down the outer skin of a ham, and place a portion
    thereof, together with such scraps as may also be
    purchased, at a penny or twopence the plateful,
    at the ham and beef emporium, with maybe a
    &ldquo;block ornament&rdquo; or two from the butcher&rsquo;s,
    in a pie dish, with a superstructure of potatoes,
    and have the &ldquo;scrap pie&rdquo; cooked at the baker&rsquo;s for
    the Sunday dinner. Poor wretches! Not much
    &ldquo;waste&rdquo; goes on in such households. But I
    have known the &ldquo;gal&rdquo; who tortured the food in
    a cheap lodging-house throw away the water
    in which a joint had just been boiled, but whether
    this was from sheer ignorance, or &ldquo;cussedness,&rdquo;
    or the desire to save herself any future labour in
    the concoction of soup, deponent sayeth not. By
    the way, it is in the matter of soup that the
    tastes of the British and French peasantry differ
    so materially. Unless he or she be absolutely
    starving, it is next to impossible to get one of the
    groundlings of old England to attempt a basin of
    soup. And when they do attempt the same, it
    has been already made for them. The Scotch,
    who are born cooks, know much better than this;
    but do not, O reader, if at all thin of skin, or
    refined of ear, listen too attentively to the thanks
    which a denizen of the &ldquo;disthressful counthry&rdquo;
    will bestow upon you for a &ldquo;dhirty bowl o&rsquo; bone-juice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How many modern diners, we wonder, know
    the original object of placing frills around the
    shank of a leg or shoulder of mutton, a ham,
    the shins of a fowl, or the bone of a cutlet?
    Fingers were made before&mdash;and a long time
    before&mdash;forks. In the seventeenth century&mdash;prior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> to which epoch not much nicety was
    observed in carving, or eating&mdash;we read that
    &ldquo;English gentlewomen were instructed by schoolmistresses
    and professors of etiquette as to the
    ways in which it behoved them to carve joints.
    That she might be able to grasp a roasted chicken
    without greasing her left hand, the gentle housewife
    was careful to trim its foot and the lower
    part of its legs with cut paper. The paper frill
    which may still be seen round the bony point
    and small end of a leg of mutton, is a memorial
    of the fashion in which joints were <i>dressed</i> for the
    dainty hands of lady-carvers, in time prior to the
    introduction of the carving-fork, an implement
    that was not in universal use so late as the
    Commonwealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long we should sit over the dinner-table
    is a matter of controversy. At the commencement
    of the nineteenth century, in the hard-drinking
    times, our forefathers were loth indeed
    to quit the table. But the fairer portion of the
    guests were accustomed to adjourn early, for tea
    and scandal in the withdrawing-room, the while
    their lords sat and quarrelled over their port, with
    locked doors; and where they fell there they
    frequently passed the night. The editor of the <i>Almanach des Gourmands</i> wrote: &ldquo;Five hours at
    table are a reasonable latitude to allow in the case
    of a large party and recondite cheer.&rdquo; But the
    worthy Grimod de la Reymière, the editor aforesaid,
    lived at a period when dinner was not served
    as late as 8.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> There is a legend of an
    Archbishop of York &ldquo;who sat three entire years
    at dinner.&rdquo; But this is one of those tales which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> specially suited the dull, brandy-sodden brains of
    our ancestors. The facts are simply as follows:&mdash;the
    archbishop had just sat down to dinner at
    noon when an Italian priest called. Hearing that
    the dignitary was sitting at meat the priest whiled
    away an hour in looking at the minster, and
    called again, but was again &ldquo;repelled by the
    porter.&rdquo; Twice more that afternoon did the
    surly porter repel the Italian, and at the fourth
    visit &ldquo;the porter, in a heate, answered never a
    worde, and churlishlie did shutte the gates upon
    him.&rdquo; Then the discomfited Italian returned to
    Rome; and three years later, encountering an
    Englishman in the Eternal City, who declared
    himself right well known to His Grace of York,
    the Italian, all smiles, inquired: &ldquo;I pray you,
    good sir, hath that archbishop finished dinner
    yet?&rdquo; Hence the story, which was doubtless
    originally told by a fly-fisher.</p>
<p>It is not a little singular that with increasing
    civilisation, a gong, which is of barbaric, or semi-barbaric
    origin, should be the means usually employed
    to summon us to the dinner-table. In
    days of yore the horn, or cornet, was blown as
    the signal. Alexander Dumas tells us that &ldquo;at
    the period when noon was the dinner hour, the
    horn or cornet (<i>le cor</i>) was used in great houses
    to announce dinner. Hence came an expression
    which has been lost; they used to say cornet (or
    trumpet) the dinner (<i>cornez le diner</i>).&rdquo; And we
    are asked to believe that to this practice &ldquo;corned&rdquo;
    beef owes its derivation. &ldquo;In days when inferior
    people ate little meat in the winter months save
    salted beef, the more usual form of the order was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> <i>cornez le b&#339;uf</i>, or &lsquo;corn the beef.&rsquo; Richardson
    errs egregiously when he insists that corned beef
    derived its distinguishing epithet from the grains
    or corns of salt with which it was pickled.
    Corned beef is trumpeted beef, or as we should
    nowadays say, dinner-bell beef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well&mdash;&ldquo;I hae ma doots,&rdquo; as the Scotsman
    said. I am not so sure that Richardson erred
    egregiously. But after all, as long as the beef be
    good, and can be carved without the aid of pick
    and spade, what does it matter? Let us to
    dinner!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A Christmas dinner in the early Victorian era! <i>Quelle fête magnifique!</i> The man who did not
    keep Christmas in a fitting manner in those days
    was not thought much of. &ldquo;Dines by himself
    at the club on Christmas day!&rdquo; was the way
    the late Mr. George Payne of sporting memory,
    summed up a certain middle-aged recluse, with
    heaps of money, who, although he had two
    estates in the country, preferred to live in two
    small rooms in St. James&rsquo;s Place, S.W., and to
    take his meals at &ldquo;Arthur&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And how we boys (not to mention the little
    lasses in white frocks and black mittens) used to
    overeat ourselves, on such occasions, with no fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> of pill, draught, or &ldquo;staying in,&rdquo; before our
    eyes!</p>
<p>The writer has in his mind&rsquo;s eye a good
    specimen of such an old-fashioned dinner, as
    served in the fifties. It was pretty much the
    same feast every Christmas. We commenced
    with some sort of clear soup, with meat in it.
    Then came a codfish, crimped&mdash;the head of that
    household would have as soon thought of eating
    a <i>sôle au vin blanc</i> as of putting before his family
    an uncrimped cod&mdash;with plenty of liver, oyster
    sauce, and pickled walnuts; and at the other end
    of the table was a dish of fried smelts. <i>Entrées?</i> Had any of the diners asked for an <i>entrée</i>, his or
    her <i>exit</i> from the room would have been a somewhat
    rapid one. A noble sirloin of Scotch beef
    faced a boiled turkey anointed with celery sauce;
    and then appeared the blazing pudding, and the
    mince-pies. For the next course, a dish of
    toasted (or rather stewed) cheese, home-made
    and full of richness, was handed round, with dry
    toast, the bearer of which was closely pursued by
    a varlet carrying a huge double-handed vessel of
    hot spiced-ale, bobbing or floating about in the
    which were roasted crab-apples and sippets of
    toast; and it was <i>de rigueur</i> for each of those
    who sat at meat to extract a sippet, to eat with
    the cheese.</p>
<p>How the old retainer, grey and plethoric with
    service, loved us boys, and how he would
    man&#339;uvre to obtain for us the tit-bits! A favoured
    servitor was &ldquo;Joseph&rdquo;; and though my revered
    progenitor was ostensibly the head of the house,
    he would, on occasion, &ldquo;run a bad second&rdquo; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> &ldquo;Joseph.&rdquo; Memory is still keen of a certain
    chilly evening in September, when the ladies
    had retired to the drawing-room, and the male
    guests were invited to be seated at the small
    table which had been wheeled close to the
    replenished fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; said the dear old man, &ldquo;bring us a
    bottle or two of the yellow seal&mdash;<i>you</i> know&mdash;Bin
    F.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servitor drew near to his master, and in a
    stage whisper exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t afford it, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; roared the indignant old
    man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t afford it, sir&mdash;Hawthornden&rsquo;s won
    th&rsquo; Leger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Gad!&rdquo; A pause&mdash;and then, &ldquo;Well,
    never mind, Joseph, we&rsquo;ll have up the yellow
    seal, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the writer&rsquo;s last Christmas dinners was
    partaken of in a sweet little house in Mayfair;
    and affords somewhat of a contrast with the
    meal quoted above. We took our appetites away
    with a salad composed of anchovies, capers,
    truffles, and other things, a Russian sardine or
    two, and rolls and butter. Thence, we drifted
    into <i>Bouillabaisse</i> (a tasty but bile-provoking
    broth), toyed with some <i>filets de sôle à la
    Parisienne</i> (good but greasy), and disposed of a <i>tournedos</i>, with a nice fat oyster atop, apiece (<i>et
    parlez-moi d&rsquo;ça!</i>). Then came some dickey-birds <i>sur canapé</i>&mdash;alleged to be snipe, but destitute
    of flavour, save that of the tin they had been
    spoiled in, and of the &ldquo;canopy.&rdquo; An alien cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> can <i>not</i> cook game, whatever choice confections
    he may turn out&mdash;at least that is the experience
    of the writer. We had <i>cressons</i>, of course, with
    the birds; though how water-cress can possibly
    assimilate with the flesh of a snipe is questionable.
    &ldquo;Water-creases&rdquo; are all very well at tea in
    the arbour, but don&rsquo;t go smoothly with any
    sort of fowl; and to put such rank stuff into
    a salad&mdash;as my hostess&rsquo;s cook did&mdash;is absolutely
    criminal.</p>
<p>To continue the Mayfair banquet, the salad
    was followed by a <i>soufflée à la Noel</i> (which reminded
    some of the more imaginative of our
    party of the festive season), some cheese straws,
    and the customary ices, coffee, and liqueurs.
    On the whole, not a bad meal; but what would
    old Father Christmas have said thereto? What
    would my revered progenitor have remarked,
    had he been allowed to revisit the glimpses of
    the moon? He did not love our lively neighbours;
    and, upon the only occasion on which he
    was inveigled across the Channel, took especial
    care to recross it the very next day, lest, through
    circumstances not under his own control, he
    might come to be &ldquo;buried amongst these d&mdash;&mdash;d
    French!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following <i>menu</i> may give some idea as to
    how</p>
<h4><i>Royalty</i></h4>
<p>entertains its guests. Said <i>menu</i>, as will be seen,
    is comparatively simple, and many of the dishes
    are French only in name:&mdash;</p>

<p>Her Imperial Majesty the Tsaritza, on the
    night of her arrival at Darmstadt, in October
    1896, sat down, together with her august husband,
    to the following simple meal:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"> Consommé de Volaille    Cronstades d&rsquo;écrevisses<br />

</p>
<p>The partiality of crowned heads towards
    &ldquo;Bavarois aux Abricots&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Bavarois&rdquo; is simply
    Bavarian cheese, a superior sort of <i>blanc mange</i>&mdash;is
    proverbial. And the above repast was served
    on priceless Meissen china and silver. The
    only remarks I will make upon the above <i>menu</i> are that it is quite possible that the capon may
    have come from Metz, though not very probable.
    French cooks name their meat and poultry in
    the most reckless fashion. For instance, owing
    to this reckless nomenclature the belief has
    grown that the best ducks come from Rouen.
    Nothing of the sort. There are just as good
    ducks raised at West Hartlepool as at Rouen.
    &ldquo;Rouen&rdquo; in the bill-of-fare is simply a corruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> of &ldquo;roan&rdquo;; and a &ldquo;roan duck&rdquo; is a quacker
    who has assumed (through crossing) the reddish
    plumage of the wild bird. As for (alleged) Surrey
    fowls, most of them come from Heathfield in
    Sussex, whence £142,000 worth were sent in
    1896.</p>
<p>Let us enquire into the composition of some
    of the high-sounding <i>plats</i>, served up by the
    average <i>chef</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Bouillabaisse.</b></i>&mdash;Of it Thackeray sang&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left:20%">
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is&mdash;<br />
            </span> <span class="i3">A sort of soup, or broth, or brew,<br />
            </span> <span class="i1">Or hotch-potch of all sorts of fishes<br />

            </span> <span class="i3">In that one dish of Bouillabaisse.&rdquo;<br />
            </span> </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Avoid eels and herrings in this concoction as
    too oily. Soles, mullet, John Dory, whiting,
    flounders, perch, roach, and mussels will blend
    well, and allow half a pound of fish for each
    person. For every pound of fish put in the
    stewpan a pint of water, a quarter of a pint of
    white wine, and a tablespoonful of salad oil. If
    there be four partakers, add two sliced onions,
    two cloves, two bay-leaves, two leeks (the white
    part only, chopped), four cloves of garlic, a
    tablespoonful chopped parsley, a good squeeze
    of lemon juice, half an ounce of chopped capsicums,
    a teaspoonful (or more <i>ad lib.</i>) of saffron,
    with pepper and salt. Mix the chopped fish in
    all this, and boil for half an hour. Let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> mixture &ldquo;gallop&rdquo; and strain into a tureen with
    sippets, and the fish served separately.</p>
<p><i><b>Tournedos.</b></i>&mdash;No relation to tornado, and you
    won&rsquo;t find the word in any Gallic dictionary.
    A <i>tournedos</i> is a thin collop of beef, steeped in
    a <i>marinade</i> for twenty-four hours (personally I
    prefer it without the aid of the marine) and fried
    lightly. Turn it but <i>once</i>. The oyster atop is
    simply scalded. <i>Try this dish.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Bisque.</b></i>&mdash;In the seventeenth century this was
    made from pigeons by the poor barbarians who
    knew not the gentle lobster, nor the confiding
    crayfish. Heat up to boiling-point a Mirepoix
    of white wine. You don&rsquo;t know what a</p>
<h4><i>Mirepoix</i></h4>
<p>is? Simply a faggot of vegetables, named after
    a notorious cuckold of noble birth in the time
    of Louis XV. Two carrots, two onions, two
    shalots, two bay-leaves, a sprig of thyme and a
    clove of garlic. Mince very small, with half a
    pound of fat bacon, half a pound of raw ham,
    pepper and salt, and a little butter. Add a
    sufficiency of white wine. In this mixture
    cook two dozen crayfish for twenty minutes,
    continually tossing them about till red, when
    take them out to cool. Shell them, all but the
    claws, which should be pounded in a mortar and
    mixed with butter. The flesh of the tails is
    reserved to be put in the soup at the last minute;
    the body-flesh goes back into the <i>mirepoix</i>, to
    which two quarts of broth are now added. Add
    the pounded shells to the soup, simmer for an
    hour and a half, strain, heat up, add a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> butter, the tails, a seasoning of cayenne, and a
    few <i>quenelles</i> of whiting.</p>
<p><i><b>Vol-au-vent Financière.</b></i>&mdash;This always reminds
    me of the fearful threat hurled by the waiter in
    the &ldquo;Bab Ballads&rdquo; at his flighty sweetheart:</p>

        goes well with most luxuries of this sort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some words which occur frequently
    in French cookery which, to the ordinary perfidious
    Briton, are cruelly misleading. For
    years I was under the impression that <i>Brillat
    Savarin</i> was a species of filleted fish (brill) in a
    rich gravy, instead of a French magistrate, who
    treated gastronomy poetically, and always ate his
    food too fast. And only within the last decade
    have I discovered what a</p>
<h4><i>Pré Salé</i></h4>
<p>really means. Literally, it is &ldquo;salt meadow, or
    marsh.&rdquo; It is said that sheep fed on a salt marsh
    make excellent mutton; but is it not about time
    for Britannia, the alleged pride of the ocean, and
    ruler of its billows, to put her foot down and
    protest against a leg of &ldquo;prime Down&rdquo;&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> recently landed from the Antipodes&mdash;being
    described on the card as a <i>Gigot de pré salé</i>?</p>
<p>The meals, like the ways, of the &ldquo;Heathen
    Chinee&rdquo; are peculiar. Some of his food, to
    quote poor Corney Grain, is &ldquo;absolutely beastly.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>Li Hung Chang</i></h4>
<p>was welcomed to Carlton House Terrace, London,
    with a dinner, in twelve courses, the following
    being the principal items:&mdash;Roast duck, roast
    pork and raspberry jam, followed by dressed
    cucumber. Shrimps were devoured, armour and
    all, with leeks, gherkins, and mushrooms. A
    couple of young chickens preserved in wine and
    vinegar, with green peas, a <i>purée</i> of pigeon&rsquo;s legs
    followed by an assortment of sour jellies. The
    banquet concluded with sponge cakes and tea.</p>
<p>In his own land the</p>
<h4><i>Chinaman&rsquo;s Evening Repast</i></h4>
<p>is much more variegated than the above. It is
    almost as long as a Chinese drama, and includes
    melon seeds, bitter almonds, bamboo sprouts,
    jelly-fish, cucumber, roast duck, chicken stewed
    in spirit dregs,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> peas, prawns, sausages, scallions,
    fish-brawn, pork chops, plum blossoms, oranges,
    bird&rsquo;s-nest soup, pigeons&rsquo; eggs in bean curd&mdash;the
    eggs being &ldquo;postponed&rdquo; ones&mdash;fungus, shrimps,
    macerated fish-fins, ham in flour, ham in honey,
    turnip cakes, roast sucking-pig, fish maws, roast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> mutton, wild ducks&rsquo; feet, water chestnuts, egg
    rolls, lily seeds, stewed mushrooms, dressed crab
    with jam, chrysanthemum pasties, <i>bêche-de-mer</i>,
    and pigs&rsquo; feet in honey. Can it be wondered at
    that this nation should have been brought to its
    knees by gallant little Japan?</p>
<h4><i>The Englishman in China</i></h4>
<p>has not a particularly good time of it, in the
    gastronomic way, and H.M. forces in Hong
    Kong are largely dependent on Shanghai for
    supplies. There is &ldquo;plenty pig&rdquo; all over the
    land; but the dairy-fed pork of old England is
    preferable. And the way &ldquo;this little pig goes
    to market&rdquo; savours so strongly of the most
    refined cruelty that a branch of the R.S.P.C.A.
    would have the busiest of times of it over yonder.</p>
<p>Reverting to French cookery, here is an
    appetising dish, called a</p>
<h4><i>Bernardin Salmi</i>.</h4>
<p>It should be prepared in the dining-room, before
    the eyes of the guests; and Grimod de la
    Reyniere (to whom the recipe was given by the
    prior of an abbey of Bernardin monks) recommends
    that the <i>salmi</i> should be conveyed to the
    mouth with a fork, for fear of devouring one&rsquo;s
    fingers, should they touch the sauce.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Take three woodcocks, underdone, and cut them
        into neat portions. On a silver dish bruise the
        livers and trails, squeeze over them the juice of
        four (?) lemons, and grate over them a little of the
        thin rind. Add the portions of woodcock, seasoned
        with salt, and&mdash;according to the prior&mdash;mixed spices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> and two teaspoonfuls of French mustard; but the
        writer would substitute cayenne <i>seul</i>; over all half
        a wine-glass of sherry; and then put the dish over
        a spirit lamp. When the mixture is <i>nearly</i> boiling,
        add a tablespoonful of salad oil, blow out the light,
        and stir well. <i>Four</i> lemons are mentioned in this
        recipe, as at the time it was written lemons were
        very small when &ldquo;cocks&rdquo; were &ldquo;in.&rdquo; <i>Two</i> imported
        lemons (or limes) will amply suffice nowadays.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>A Salmi of Wild Duck</i></h4>
<p>can be made almost in the same way, but here
    the aid of that modern instrument the <i>Duck-Squeezer</i> is necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Cut the best of the meat in slices, off a lightly-roasted
        wild-duck, after brought to table; break up
        the carcase and place in a species of mill (silver)
        called a &ldquo;duck-squeezer,&rdquo; which possesses a spout
        through which the richness of the animal escapes,
        after being squeezed. Make a gravy of this liquor,
        in a silver dish (with a spirit lamp beneath), added
        to a small pat of butter, the juice of a lemon, a
        tablespoonful of Worcester sauce, with cayenne and
        salt to taste, and half a wine-glassful of port wine.
        Warm the meat through in this gravy, which must
        not boil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course these two last-named dishes are only
    intended for bachelor-parties. Lovely woman
    must not be kept waiting for &ldquo;duck-squeezers&rdquo;
    or anything else.</p>
<h4><i>The Jesuits</i></h4>
<p>introduced the turkey into Europe, of which
    feat the Jesuits need not boast too much; for to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> some minds there be many better edible birds; and
    the &ldquo;gobbler&rdquo; requires, when roasted or boiled,
    plenty of seasoning to make him palatable. The
    French stuff him in his roasted state, with
    truffles, fat force-meat, or chestnuts, and invariably
    &ldquo;bard&rdquo; the bird&mdash;&ldquo;bard&rdquo; is old English as well
    as old French&mdash;with fat bacon. The French
    turkey is also frequently brazed, with an abundant <i>mirepoix</i> made with what their cooks call
    &ldquo;Madére,&rdquo; but which is really Marsala. It is
    only we English who boil the &ldquo;gobbler,&rdquo; and
    stuff him (or her, for it is the hen who usually
    goes into the pot) with oysters, or force-meat,
    with celery sauce. Probably the best parts of
    the turkey are his legs, when grilled for breakfast,
    and smothered with the sauce mentioned in one
    of the chapters on &ldquo;Breakfast&rdquo;; and</p>
<h4><i>Pulled Turkey</i></h4>
<p>makes an agreeable luncheon-dish, or <i>entrée</i> at
    dinner, the breast-meat being pulled off the bone
    with a fork, and fricasseed, surrounded in the dish
    by the grilled thighs and pinions.</p>
<p>Who introduced the turkey into America
    deponent sayeth not. Probably, like Topsy,
    it &ldquo;growed&rdquo; there. Anyhow the bird is so
    familiar a table-companion in the States, that
    Americans, when on tour in Europe, fight very
    shy of him. &ldquo;Tukkey, sah, cranberry sarce,&rdquo;
    used to be the stereotyped reply of the black
    waiter when interrogated on the subject of the
    bill of fare.</p>
<h4><i>Coloured Help</i></h4>
<p>is, however, gradually being ousted (together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> with sulphur matches) from the big hotels in
    New York, where white waiting and white food
    are coming into, or have come into, regular use.
    In fact, with the occasional addition of one or
    other of such special dishes as terrapin, soft-shell
    crab, clam chowder, and the everlasting pork
    and beans, a dinner in New York differs very
    little at the time of writing (1897) from one in
    London. The taste for</p>
<h4><i>Clam Chowder</i></h4>
<p>is an acquired one, nor will stewed tortoise ever
    rank with thick turtle in British estimation,
    although &rsquo;tis not the same tortoise which is used in
    London households to break the coals with. A</p>
<h4><i>Canvass-back Duck</i>,</h4>
<p>if eaten in the land of his birth, is decidedly the
    most delicately-flavoured of all the &ldquo;Quack&rdquo;
    family. His favourite food is said to be wild
    celery, and his favoured haunts the neighbourhood
    of Chesapeake Bay, from whose waters comes
    the much prized &ldquo;diamond-back&rdquo; terrapin,
    which is sold at the rate of 50$ or 60$ the dozen.
    The canvass-back duck, however, suffers in transportation;
    in fact, the tendency of the ice-house
    aboard ship is to rob all food of its flavour.</p>
<p>But however good be the living in</p>
<h4><i>New York City</i></h4>
<p>&mdash;where the hotels are the best in the world, and
    whose <i>Mr. Delmonico</i> can give points to all
    sorts and conditions of food caterers&mdash;it is &ldquo;a
    bit rough&rdquo; in the provinces. There is a story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> told of a young actor, on tour, who &ldquo;struck&rdquo;
    a small town out West, and put up at a small
    inn. In the course of time dinner was served,
    and the landlord waited at table. The principal
    cover was removed, disclosing a fine joint of
    coarsish, indifferently-cooked beef. Our young
    actor was strangely moved at the sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Beef again? This is
    horrible! I&rsquo;ve seen no other food for months,
    and I&rsquo;m sick and tired of it. I can&rsquo;t eat beef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon his host whipped out a huge
    &ldquo;six-shooter&rdquo; revolver, and covering the recalcitrant
    beef-eater, coolly remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you kin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t believe that story, any more than
    I believe the anecdote of the cowboys and the
    daylight let through the visitor who couldn&rsquo;t eat
    beans.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; inquired the love-sick
    Juliet. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; echoes the bad fairy &ldquo;<i>Ala</i>.&rdquo;
    After all the fuss made by the French over their
    soups, we might expect more variety than is
    given us. If it be true that we English have only
    one sauce, it is equally true that our lively neighbours
    have only one soup&mdash;and that one is a broth.
    It is known to the frequenters of restaurants
    under at least eleven different names <i>Brunoise</i>, <i>Jardinière</i>, <i>Printanier</i>, <i>Chiffonade</i>, <i>Macédoine</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> <i>Julienne</i>, <i>Faubonne</i>, <i>Paysanne</i>, <i>Flamande</i>, <i>Mitonnage</i>, <i>Croûte au Pot</i>, and, as Sam Weller would
    say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the flavouring as does it.&rdquo; It is simply <i>bouillon</i>, plain broth, and weak at that. The
    addition of a cabbage, or a leek, or a common
    or beggar&rsquo;s crust, will change a <i>potage à la
    Jardinière</i> into a <i>Croûte au Pot</i>, and <i>vice versa</i>.
    Great is &ldquo;<i>Ala</i>&rdquo;; and five hundred per cent is
    her profit!</p>
<p>The amount of money lavished by diners-about
    upon the productions of the alien <i>chef</i> would be ludicrous to consider, were not the
    extravagance absolutely criminal. The writer
    has partaken of about the most expensive dinner&mdash;English
    for the most part, with French names to
    the dishes&mdash;that could be put on the table, the
    charge being (including wines) one guinea per
    mouth. Another banquet, given by a gay youth
    who had acquired a large sum through ruining
    somebody else on the Stock Exchange&mdash;the meal
    positively reeking of <i>Ala</i>&mdash;was charged for by
    the hotel manager at the rate of <i>sixteen pounds</i> per
    head, also including wines. I was told afterwards,
    though I am still sceptical as to the veracity of
    the statement, that the flowers on the table at
    that banquet cost alone more than £75. And
    only on the previous Sunday, our host&rsquo;s father&mdash;a
    just nobleman and a God-fearing&mdash;had
    delivered a lecture, at a popular institution, on
    &ldquo;Thrift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here follows the <i>menu</i> of the above-mentioned
    guinea meal,</p>

<p>And some of the younger officers complained
    bitterly at having to pay £1:1s. for the privilege
    of &ldquo;larking&rdquo; over such a course!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>There are only three faults I can find in the
    above programme: (1) Confusion to the man
    who expects the British Army to swallow green
    fat in French. (2) Whitebait is far too delicately
    flavoured a fowl to curry. (3) Too much eating
    and drinking.</p>
<h4><i>City Dinners</i></h4>
<p>are for the most part an infliction (or affliction)
    on the diner. With more than fourscore sitting
    at meat, the miracle of the loaves and fishes is
    repeated&mdash;with, frequently, the fish left out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you my word, dear old chappie,&rdquo; once
    exclaimed a gilded youth who had been assisting
    at one of these functions, to the writer, &ldquo;all I
    could get hold of, during the struggle, was an
    orange and a cold plate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great and powerful system of</p>
<h4><i>Baksheesh</i>,</h4>
<p>of course, enters largely into these public entertainments;
    and the man who omits to fee the
    waiter in advance, as a rule, &ldquo;gets left.&rdquo; Bookmakers
    and others who go racing are the
    greatest sinners in this respect. A well-known
    magnate of the betting-ring (1896) invariably,
    after arriving at an hotel, hunts up the <i>chef</i>, and
    sheds upon him a &ldquo;fiver,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;tenner,&rdquo; according
    to the size of the house, and the repute of its
    cookery. And that metallician and his party
    are not likely to starve during their stay,
    whatever may be the fate of those who omit to
    &ldquo;remember&rdquo; the Commissariat Department. I
    have seen the same bookmaker carry, with his own
    hands, the remains of a great dish of &ldquo;Hot-pot&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> into the dining-room of his neighbours, who had
    been ringing for a waiter, and clamouring for
    food for the best part of an hour, without effect.</p>
<p>The same system prevails aboard ship; and
    the passenger who has not propitiated the head
    steward at the commencement of the voyage
    will not fare sumptuously. The steamship companies
    may deny this statement; but &rsquo;tis true
    nevertheless.</p>
<h4><i>Dinner Afloat.</i></h4>
<p>Here is an average dinner-card during a life
    on the ocean wave:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Julienne soup, boiled salmon with shrimp sauce,
        roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, jugged hare,
        French beans <i>à la Maître d&rsquo;Hôtel</i>, chicken curry,
        roast turkey with <i>purée</i> of chestnuts, <i>fanchouettes</i> (what are they?), sausage rolls, greengage tarts,
        plum-puddings, lemon-jellies, biscuits and cheese,
        fruit, coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plenty of variety here, though some epicures
    might resent the presence of a sausage-roll (the
    common or railway-station bag of mystery) on
    the dinner table. But since the carriage of live
    stock aboard passenger ships has been abandoned,
    the living is not nearly as good; for, as before
    observed, the tendency of the ice-house is to
    make all flesh taste alike. Civilisation has,
    doubtless, done wonders for us; but most people
    prefer mutton to have a flavour distinct from
    that of beef.</p>
<p>My</p>
<h4><i>Ideal Dinner</i></h4>
<p>was partaken of in a little old-fashioned hostelry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> (at the west end of London), whose name the
    concentrated efforts of all the wild horses in the
    world would not extract. Familiarity breeds
    contempt, and publicity oft kills that which
    is brought to light. Our host was a wine-merchant
    in a large way of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only promise you plain food, good sirs,&rdquo;
    he mentioned, in advance&mdash;&ldquo;no foreign kick-shaws;
    but everything done to a turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six of us started with clear turtle, followed by
    a thick wedge out of the middle of a patriarchal
    codfish, with plenty of liver. And here a pause
    must be made. In not one cookery-book known
    to mankind can be found a recipe for cooking the</p>
<h4><i>Liver of a Cod</i>.</h4>
<p>Of course it should not be cooked <i>with</i> the fish,
    but in a separate vessel. The writer once went
    the rounds of the kitchens to obtain information
    on this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout half-an-hour,&rdquo; said one cook, a &ldquo;hard-bitten&rdquo;
    looking food-spoiler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> I cook not at all the liver of the
    cod,&rdquo; said an unshorn son of Normandy. &ldquo;He
    is for the <i>malade</i> only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After asking a number of questions, and a
    journey literally &ldquo;round the town,&rdquo; the deduction
    made from the various answers was that a piece
    of liver enough for six people would take eighteen
    minutes, after being placed in <i>boiling</i> water.</p>
<p>To continue with our dinner. No sauce
    with the oysters, but these simply scalded in
    their own liquor. Then came on a monster
    steak, an inch thick, cut from the rump immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> before being placed on the gridiron. And
    here a word on the grilling of a steak. We
    English place it nearer the fire than do our
    lively neighbours, whose grills do not, in consequence,
    present that firm surface which is the
    charm of an English steak. The late Mr.
    Godfrey Turner of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (who
    was almost as great an authority as Mr. Sala
    on gastronomies) once observed to the writer,
    &ldquo;Never turn your steak, or chop, more than
    once.&rdquo; Though by no means a disciple of <i>Ala</i>, he was evidently a believer in the French
    method of grilling, which leaves a sodden, flabby
    surface on the meat. The French cook only
    turns a steak once; but if he had his gridiron as
    close to the fire as his English rival, the <i>chef</i> would inevitably cremate his <i>morçeau d&rsquo;b&#339;uf</i>. I
    take it that in grilling, as in roasting, the meat
    should, in the first instance, almost touch the
    glowing embers.</p>
<p>We had nothing but horse-radish with our
    steak, which was succeeded by golden plovers
    (about the best bird that flies) and marrow
    bones. And a dig into a ripe Stilton concluded
    a banquet which we would not have exchanged
    for the best efforts of Francatelli himself.</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;despite the efforts of the bad fairy <i>Ala</i>,
    the English method of cooking good food&mdash;if
    deftly and properly employed&mdash;is a long way the
    better method. Unfortunately, through the fault
    of the English themselves, this method is but
    seldom employed deftly or properly. And at a
    cheap English eating-house the kitchen is usually
    as dirty and malodorous as at an inexpensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> foreign restaurant. As both invariably serve as
    sleeping apartments during the silent watches of
    the night, this is, perhaps, not altogether to be
    wondered at.</p>
<p>But there is one <i>plât</i> in the French cookery
    book which is not to be sneered at, or even condemned
    with faint praise. A properly-dressed <i>fricandeau</i> is a dainty morsel indeed. In fact the
    word <i>fricand</i> means, in English, &ldquo;dainty.&rdquo;
    Here is the recipe of the celebrated <i>Gouffé</i> for
    the <span class="smcap">Fricandeau</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Three pounds of veal fillet, trimmed, and larded
        with fat bacon. Put in the glazing stewpan the
        trimmings, two ounces of sliced carrot, two ditto
        onion, with pepper and salt. Lay the <i>fricandeau</i> on
        the top; add half a pint of broth; boil the broth
        till it is reduced and becomes thick and yellow;
        add a pint and a half more broth, and simmer for an
        hour and a quarter&mdash;the stewpan half covered.
        Then close the stewpan and put live coals on the
        top. Baste the <i>fricandeau</i> with the gravy&mdash;presumably
        after the removal of the dead coals&mdash;every
        four minutes till it is sufficiently glazed; then take
        it out and place on a dish. Strain the gravy, skim
        off the fat, and pour over the meat. It may be
        added that a spirit lamp beneath the dish is (or
        should be) <i>de rigueur</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their clubs, those (alleged) &ldquo;gilded saloons
    of profligacy and debauchery, favoured of the
    aristocracy,&rdquo; men, as a rule dine wisely, and well,
    and, moreover, cheaply. The extravagant diner-out,
    with his crude views on the eternal fitness
    of things, selects an hotel, or restaurant, in the
    which, although the food may be of the worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> quality, and the cookery of the greasiest, the
    charges are certain to be on the millionaire scale.
    For bad dinners, like bad lodgings, are invariably
    the dearest.</p>
<h4><i>At the Mess-Table</i></h4>
<p>of the British officer there is not much riot or
    extravagance nowadays, and the food is but indifferently
    well cooked; though there was a
    time when the youngest cornet would turn up
    his nose at anything commoner than a &ldquo;special <i>cuvée</i>&rdquo; of champagne, and would unite with his
    fellows in the &ldquo;bear-fight&rdquo; which invariably
    concluded a &ldquo;guest night,&rdquo; and during which
    the messman, or one of his myrmidons, was
    occasionally placed atop of the ante-room fire.
    And there was one messman who even preferred
    that mode of treatment to being lectured by his
    colonel. Said officer was starchy, punctilious,
    and long-winded, and upon one occasion, when
    the chaplain to the garrison was his guest at
    dinner, addressed the terrified servant somewhat
    after this wise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Messman&mdash;I have this evening bidden
    to our feast this eminent divine, who prayeth
    daily that we may receive the fruits of the earth
    in due season; to which I, an humble layman,
    am in the habit of responding: &lsquo;We beseech thee
    to hear us, good Lord.&rsquo; Mr. Messman, don&rsquo;t
    let me see those d&mdash;&mdash;d figs on the table again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a military guest-night in India, a turkey
    and a &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; ham are&mdash;or were&mdash;<i>de rigueur</i> at table; and on the whole the warrior fares
    well, if the <i>khansamah</i> do not attempt luxuries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> His chicken cutlets are not despicable, and we
    can even forgive the repetition of the <i>vilolif</i> but
    his <i>bifisteakishtoo</i> (stewed steak) is usually too
    highly-spiced for the European palate. Later in
    the evening, however, he will come out strong
    with <i>duvlebone</i>, and grilled sardines in curlpapers.
    The presence of the bagpipes, in the mess-room
    of a Highland regiment, when men have well
    drunk, is cruelly unkind&mdash;to the Saxon guest at
    all events. The bagpipe is doubtless a melodious
    instrument (to trained ears), but its melodies are
    apt to &ldquo;hum i&rsquo; th&rsquo; head o&rsquo;er muckle ye ken,&rdquo;
    after a course of haggis washed down with
    sparkling wines and old port.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what a man eats,&rdquo; said Brillat
    Savarin, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you what he is.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>Peter the Great</i></h4>
<p>did not like the presence of &ldquo;listening lacqueys&rdquo;
    in the dining-room. Peter&rsquo;s favourite dinner was,
    like himself, peculiar: &ldquo;A soup, with four cabbages
    in it; gruel; pig, with sour cream for sauce; cold
    roast meat with pickled cucumbers or salad;
    lemons and lamprey, salt meat, ham, and Limburg
    cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemons and lamprey&rdquo; must have had a
    roughish seat, atop of pig and sour cream. I
    once tasted lampreys&mdash;only once. It was in
    Worcestershire, and said lampreys were stewed
    (I fancy) in burgundy, and served in a small
    tureen&mdash;<i>en casserole</i>, our lively neighbours would
    have called the production, which was grateful,
    but much embarrassed with richness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Napoleon the Great</i>,</h4>
<p>whose tastes were simple, is said to have preferred
    a broiled breast of mutton to any other dinner-dish.
    Napoleon III., however, encouraged extravagance
    of living; and Zola tells us in <i>Le
    Débâcle</i> that the unfortunate emperor, ill as he
    was, used to sit down to so many courses of rich
    foods every night until &ldquo;the downfall&rdquo; arrived
    at Sédan, and that a train of cooks and scullions
    with (literally) a &ldquo;<i>batterie</i>&rdquo; <i>de cuisine</i>, was
    attached to his staff.</p>
<h4><i>Her Majesty</i></h4>
<p>Queen Victoria&rsquo;s dinner-table is invariably graced
    with a cold sirloin of beef, amongst other joints;
    and the same simple fare has satisfied the aspirations
    and gratified the palate of full many a
    celebrity. The great</p>
<h4><i>Duke of Wellington</i></h4>
<p>was partial to a well-made Irish stew; and
    nothing delighted Charles Dickens more than a
    slice out of the breast of a hot roast-goose.</p>
<p>A word about the mushroom. Although said
    to be of enormous value in sauces and ragouts, I
    shall always maintain that the mushroom is best
    when eaten all by his quaint self. His flavour is
    so delicate that &rsquo;tis pitiful to mix him with fish,
    flesh, or fowl&mdash;more especially the first-named.
    I have seen mushrooms and bacon cooked
    together, and I have seen beef-steak (cut into
    small pieces) and bacon cooked together,
    and it was with some difficulty that my Irish
    host got me out of the kitchen. If ever I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> hanged, it will be for killing a cook. Above
    all never eat mushrooms which you have not
    seen in their uncooked state. The mushroom,
    like the truffle, loses more flavour the longer he
    is kept; and to &ldquo;postpone&rdquo; either is fatal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plainer the meal the longer the life.&rdquo;
    Thus an eminent physician&mdash;already mentioned
    in these pages. &ldquo;We begin with soup, and
    perhaps a glass of cold punch, to be followed by
    a piece of turbot, or a slice of salmon with
    lobster sauce; and while the venison or South-down
    is getting ready, we toy with a piece of
    sweetbread, and mellow it with a bumper of
    Madeira. No sooner is the mutton or venison
    disposed of, with its never-failing accompaniments
    of jelly and vegetables, than we set the
    whole of it in a ferment with champagne, and
    drown it with hock and sauterne. These are
    quickly followed by the wing and breast of a
    partridge, or a bit of pheasant or wild duck; and
    when the stomach is all on fire with excitement,
    we cool it for an instant with a piece of iced
    pudding, and then immediately lash it into a fury
    with undiluted alcohol in the form of cognac
    or a strong liqueur; after which there comes
    a spoonful or so of jelly as an emollient, a morsel
    of ripe Stilton as a digestant, a piquant salad to
    whet the appetite for wine, and a glass of old port
    to persuade the stomach, if it can, into quietness.
    All these are more leisurely succeeded by dessert,
    with its baked meats, its fruits, and its strong
    drinks, to be afterwards muddled with coffee,
    and complicated into a rare mixture with tea,
    floating with the richest cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>Hoity, toity! And not a word about a French <i>plât</i>, or even a curry, either! But we must
    remember that this diatribe comes from a gentleman
    who has laid down the theory that cold
    water is not only the cheapest of beverages, but
    the best. Exception, too, may be taken to the
    statement that a &ldquo;piquant salad&rdquo; whets the
    appetite for wine. I had always imagined that a
    salad&mdash;and, indeed, anything with vinegar in its
    composition&mdash;rather spoilt the human palate for
    wine than otherwise. And what sort of &ldquo;baked
    meats&rdquo; are usually served with desert?</p>
<h4><i>How the Poor Live.</i></h4>
<p>An esteemed friend who has seen better days,
    sends word how to dine a man, his wife, and
    three children for 7½d. He heads his letter</p>
<h4><i>The Kent Road Cookery</i>.</h4>
<p>A stew is prepared with the following ingredients:
    1 lb. bullock&rsquo;s cheek (3½d.), ½ pint white
    beans (1d.), ½ pint lentils (1d.), pot-herbs (1d.),
    2 lb. potatoes (1d.)&mdash;Total 7½d.</p>
<p>When he has friends, the banquet is more
    expensive: 1 lb. bullock&rsquo;s cheek (3½d.), ½ lb.
    cow-heel (2½d.), ½ lb. leg of beef (3d.), 1 pint
    white beans (2d.), ½ pint lentils (1d.), pot-herbs
    (1d.), 5 lb. potatoes (2d.)&mdash;total 1s. 3d.</p>
<p>As we never know what may happen, the
    above <i>menus</i> may come in useful.</p>
<h4><i>Doctor Nansen&rsquo;s Banquet</i></h4>
<p>on the ice-floe, to celebrate his failure to discover
    the Pole, was simple enough, at all events. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> it would hardly commend itself to the <i>fin de
    siècle</i> &ldquo;Johnny.&rdquo; There was raw gull in it, by
    way of a full-flavoured combination of <i>poisson</i> and <i>entrée</i>; there was meat chocolate in it, and
    peli&mdash;I should say, pemmican. There were
    pancakes, made of oatmeal and dog&rsquo;s blood,
    fried in seal&rsquo;s blubber. And I rather fancy the <i>relevé</i> was <i>Chien au nature</i>. For in his most
    interesting work, <i>Across Greenland</i>, Doctor
    Nansen has inserted the statement that the
    man who turns his nose up at raw dog for
    dinner is unfit for an Arctic expedition. For
    my own poor part, I would take my chance
    with a Porterhouse steak, cut from a Polar bear.</p>
<h4><i>Prison Fare.</i></h4>
<p>Another simple meal. Any visitor to one
    of H.M. penitentiaries may have noticed in
    the cells a statement to the effect that &ldquo;beans
    and bacon&rdquo; may be substituted for meat, for
    the convicts&rsquo; dinners, on certain days. &ldquo;Beans
    and bacon&rdquo; sounds rural, if not absolutely bucolic.
    &ldquo;Fancy giving such good food to the wretches!&rdquo;
    once exclaimed a lady visitor. But those who
    have sampled the said &ldquo;beans and bacon&rdquo; say
    that it is hardly to be preferred to the six ounces
    of Australian dingo or the coarse suet-duff
    (plumless) which furnish the ordinary prison
    dinner. For the tablespoonful of pappy beans
    with which the captive staves off starvation are
    of the <i>genus</i> &ldquo;haricot&rdquo;; and the parallelogram
    of salted hog&rsquo;s-flesh which accompanies the beans
    does not exceed, in size, the ordinary railway
    ticket.</p>

<p>Item, the <span class="smcap">Potato</span>, earth-apple, murphy, or spud;
    the most useful, as well as the most exasperating
    gift of a bountiful Providence. Those inclined to
    obesity may skip the greater part of this chapter.
    You can employ a potato for almost anything.
    It comes in very handy for the manufacture of
    starch, sugar, Irish stew, Scotch whisky, and
    Colorado beetles. Cut it in half, and with one
    half you restore an old master, and with the other
    drive the cat from the back garden. More deadly
    battles have been waged over the proper way to
    cook a potato, than over a parish boundary, or
    an Irish eviction. Strong-headed men hurl the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> spud high in air, and receive and fracture it on
    their frontal bones; whilst a juggler like Paul
    Cinquevalli can do what he likes with it. Worn
    inside the pocket, it is an infallible cure for
    chronic rheumatism, fits, and tubercular meningitis.
    Worn inside the body it will convert a
    living skeleton into a Daniel Lambert. Plant
    potatoes in a game district, and if they come up
    you will find that after the haulms have withered
    you can capture all your rich neighbour&rsquo;s pheasants,
    and half the partridges in the country. A
    nicely-baked potato, deftly placed beneath the
    root of his tail, will make the worst &ldquo;jibber&rdquo; in
    the world travel; whilst, when combined with
    buttermilk, and a modicum of meal, the earth-apple
    has been known to nourish millions of the
    rising generation, and to give them sufficient
    strength and courage to owe their back rents,
    and accuracy of aim for exterminating the brutal
    owner of the soil.</p>
<p>The waiter, bless ye! the harmless, flat-footed
    waiter, doesn&rsquo;t know all this. Potatoes to him are
    simply 2d. or 3d. in the little account, according
    to whether they be &ldquo;biled, mash, or soty&rdquo;; and
    if questioned as to the natural history of the
    floury tuber, he would probably assume an air of
    injured innocence, and assure you that during his
    reign of &ldquo;thirty-five year, man and boy,&rdquo; that
    establishment had &ldquo;never &rsquo;ad no complaints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The experiences of the writer as a potato
    grower have been somewhat mixed, and occasionally
    like the following:&mdash;Set your snowflakes
    in deeply-trenched, heavily-manured
    ground, a foot apart. In due time you will get
    a really fine crop of groundsel, charlock, and
    slugs, with enough bind-weed to strangle the sea-serpent.
    Clear all this rubbish off, and after a
    week or two the eye will be gladdened with the
    sight of the delicate green leaf of the tuber peeping
    through the soil. Slow music. Enter the
    Earl of Frost. No; they will not <i>all</i> be cut off.
    You will get <i>one</i> tuber. Peel it carefully, and
    place it in the pig-stye&mdash;the peeling spoils the
    quality of the pork. Throw the peeling away&mdash;on
    the bed in which you have sown annuals for
    choice&mdash;and in the late Spring you will have a
    row of potatoes which will do you credit.</p>
<p>But this is frivolous. The origin of the
    potato is doubtful; but that it was used by the
    ancients, in warfare, is tolerably certain. Long
    before the Spaniards reached the New World it
    was cultivated largely by the Incas; and it was
    the Spaniards who brought the tuber to Europe, in
    the beginning of the sixteenth century. It was
    brought to England from Virginia by Sir John
    Hawkins in 1563; and again in 1586 by Sir
    Francis Drake, to whom, as the introducer of
    the potato, a statue was erected at Offenburg, in
    Baden, in 1853. In schools and other haunts of
    ignorance, the credit for the introduction of the
    tuber used to be and is (I believe) still given to
    Sir Walter Raleigh, who has been wrongly
    accredited with as many &ldquo;good things&rdquo; as have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> been Theodore Hook or Sidney Smith. And I
    may mention <i>en parenthèse</i>, that I don&rsquo;t entirely
    believe that cloak story. For many years the
    tuber was known in England as the &ldquo;Batata&rdquo;&mdash;overhaul
    your <i>Lorna Doone</i>&mdash;and in France, until
    the close of the eighteenth century, the earth apple
    was looked upon with suspicion, as the cause of
    leprosy and assorted fevers; just as the tomato,
    at the close of the more civilised nineteenth
    century, is said by the vulgar and swine-headed
    to breed cancer.</p>
<p>Now then, With or without the jacket? And
    the reader who imagines that I am going to
    answer the question has too much imagination.
    As the old butler in Wilkie Collins&rsquo;s <i>The Moonstone</i> observes, there is much to be said on both sides.
    Personally I lean to the &ldquo;no-jacket&rdquo; side, unless
    the tuber be baked; and I would make it penal
    to serve a potato in any other way than boiled,
    steamed, or baked.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The bad fairy <i>Ala</i> should
    have no hand in its manipulation; and there be
    few æsthetic eaters who would not prefer the old-fashioned
    &ldquo;ball of flour&rdquo; to slices of the sodden
    article swimming in a bath of grease and parsley,
    and called a <i>Sauté</i>. The horrible concoction
    yclept &ldquo;preserved potatoes,&rdquo; which used to be
    served out aboard sailing vessels, after the passengers
    had eaten all the real articles, and which
    tasted like bad pease-pudding dressed with furniture
    polish, is, happily, deceased. And the best
    potatoes, the same breed which our fathers and
    our forefathers munched in the Covent Garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> &ldquo;Cave of Harmony,&rdquo; grow, I am credibly informed,
    in Jermyn Street. Moreover if you wish to spoil
    a dish of good spuds, there is no surer way than
    by leaving on the dish-cover. So much for

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cabbage</span> is a fine, friendly fellow, who
    makes himself at home, and generally useful, in
    the garden; whilst his great heart swells, and
    swells, in the full knowledge that he is doing his
    level best to please all. Though cut down in
    the springtime of his youth, his benevolence is so
    great that he will sprout again from his headless
    trunk, if required, and given time for reflection.
    The Romans introduced him into Great Britain,
    but there was a sort of cow-cabbage in the island
    before that time which our blue forefathers used
    to devour with their bacon, and steaks, in a raw
    state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most evolved and final variety of the
    cabbage,&rdquo; writes a <i>savant</i>, &ldquo;is the <span class="smcap">Cauliflower</span>,
    in which the vegetative surplus becomes poured
    into the flowering head, of which the flowering is
    more or less checked; the inflorescence becoming
    a dense corymb instead of an open panicle, and
    the majority of the flowers aborting&rdquo;&mdash;the head
    gardener usually tells you all this in the Scottish
    language&mdash;&ldquo;so as to become incapable of producing
    seed. Let a specially vegetative cabbage
    repeat the excessive development of its leaf parenchyma,
    and we have the wrinkled and blistered <span class="smcap">Savoy</span>, of which the hardy constitution, but comparative
    coarseness, become also more intelligible;
    again a specially vegetative cauliflower gives us
    an easily grown and hardy winter variety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Broccoli</span>&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Broccilo</i> in Costerese&mdash;&ldquo;from which,
    and not from the ordinary cauliflower, a sprouting
    variety arises in turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Jersey the cabbage-stalks are dried, varnished,
    and used as spars for thatched roofs, as
    also for the correction of the youthful population.
    Cook all varieties of the cabbage in water already
    at the boil, with a little salt and soda in it. The
    French sprinkle cheese on a cauliflower, to make
    it more tasty, and it then becomes</p>
<h4><i>Choufleur aû Gratin</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Remove the green leaves, and <i>underboil</i> your
        cauliflower. Pour over it some butter sauce in
        which have been mixed two ounces of grated cheese&mdash;half
        Gruyère and half Parmesan. Powder with
        bread crumbs, or raspings, and with more grated
        cheese. Lastly, pour over it a teaspoonful of oiled
        butter. Place in a hot oven and bake till the
        surface is a golden brown, which should be in from
        ten to fifteen minutes. Serve in same dish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vegetarians should be particularly careful to
    soak every description of cabbage in salt and
    water before cooking. Otherwise the vegetarians
    will probably eat a considerable portion of animal
    food.</p>
<p>Here occurs an opportunity for the recipe for
    an elegant dish, which the French call <i>Perdrix
    aux Choux</i>, which is simply</p>
<h4><i>Partridge Stewed with Cabbage, etc.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>A brace of birds browned in the stewpan with
        butter or good dripping, and a portion of a hand of
        pickled pork in small pieces, some chopped onion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> and a clove or two. Add some broth, two carrots
        (chopped), a bay-leaf, and a chopped sausage or two.
        Then add a Savoy cabbage, cut into quarters, and
        seasoned with pepper and salt. Let all simmer
        together for an hour and a half. Then drain the
        cabbage, and place it, squashed down, on a dish.
        Arrange the birds in the middle, surround them
        with the pieces of pork and sausage, and pour over
        all the liquor from the stew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent dish, and savours more of
    Teutonic than of French cooking. But you
    mustn&rsquo;t tell a Frenchman this, if he be bigger
    than yourself.</p>
<p>The toothsome <span class="smcap">Pea</span> has been cultivated in
    the East from time immemorial, though the
    ancient Greeks and Romans do not appear to
    have had knowledge of such a dainty. Had
    Vitellius known the virtues of duck and green
    peas he would probably have not been so wrapt up
    in his favourite dormice, stuffed with poppy-seed
    and stewed in honey. The ancient Egyptians
    knew all about the little pulse, and not one of
    the leaders of society was mummified without a
    pod or two being placed amongst his wrappings.
    And after thousand of years said peas, when
    sown, have been known to germinate. The
    mummy pea-plant, however, but seldom bears
    fruit. Our idiotic ancestors, the ancient Britons,
    knew nothing about peas, nor do any of their
    descendants appear to have troubled about the
    vegetable before the reign of the Virgin Queen.
    Then they were imported from Holland, together
    with schnapps, curaçoa, and other things, and
    no &ldquo;swagger&rdquo; banquet was held without a dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> of &ldquo;fresh-shelled &rsquo;uns,&rdquo; which were accounted
    &ldquo;fit dainties for ladies, they came so far and cost
    so dear.&rdquo; In England up-to-date peas are
    frequently accompanied by pigeon pie at table;
    the dove family being especially partial to the
    little pulse, either when attached to the haulm,
    in the garden, or in a dried state. So that the
    crafty husbandman, who possesses a shot gun,
    frequently gathereth both pea and pigeon. A
    chalky soil is especially favourable to pea cultivation;
    and deal sawdust sprinkled well over the
    rows immediately after the setting of the seed
    will frustrate the knavish tricks of the field
    mouse, who also likes peas. The man who
    discovered the affinity between mint and this
    vegetable ought to have received a gold medal,
    and I would gladly attend the execution of the
    caitiff who invented the tinned peas which we
    get at the foreign restaurants, at three times the
    price of the English article.</p>
<p>Here is a good simple recipe for <span class="smcap">Pea Soup</span>,
    made from the dried article:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Soak a quart of split peas in rain-water for twelve
        hours. Put them in the pot with one carrot, one
        onion, one leek, a sprig or two of parsley (all chopped),
        one pound of streaky bacon, and three quarts of the
        liquor in which either beef, mutton, pork, or poultry
        may have been boiled. Boil for nearly three hours,
        remove the bacon, and strain the soup through a
        tammy. Heat up, and serve with dried mint, and
        small cubes of fat bacon fried crisp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Green-Pea Soup</span> is made in precisely the
    same way; but the peas will not need soaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> beforehand, and thrifty housewives put in the
    shells as well.</p>
<p>Harmless and nutritious a vegetable as the <span class="smcap">Bean</span> would appear to be, it did not altogether
    find favour with the ancients. Pythagoras, who
    had quaint ideas on the subject of the human
    soul, forbade his disciples to eat beans, because
    they were generated in the foul ooze out of
    which man was created. Lucian, who had a
    vivid imagination, describes a philosopher in
    Hades who was particularly hard on the bean,
    to eat which he declared was as great a crime
    as to eat one&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s head. And yet Lucian
    was accounted a man of common sense in his
    time. The Romans only ate beans at funerals,
    being under the idea that the souls of the dead
    abode in the vegetable. According to tradition,
    the &ldquo;caller herrin&rsquo;&rdquo; hawked in the streets of
    Edinburgh were once known as &ldquo;lives o&rsquo; men,&rdquo;
    from the risks run by the fishermen. And the
    Romans introduced the bean into England by way
    of cheering up our blue forefathers. In the Roman
    festival of Lemuralia, the father of the family was
    accustomed to throw black beans over his head,
    whilst repeating an incantation. This ceremony
    probably inspired Lucian&rsquo;s philosopher&mdash;for
    whom, however, every allowance should be made,
    when we come to consider his place of residence&mdash;with
    his jaundiced views of the <i>Faba vulgaris</i>.
    Curiously enough, amongst the vulgar folk, at the
    present day, there would seem to be some sort of
    prejudice against the vegetable; or why should
    &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him beans&rdquo; be a synonymous threat
    with &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do him all the mischief I can?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>There is plenty of nourishment in a bean;
    that is the opinion of the entire medical faculty.
    And whilst beans and bacon make a favourite
    summer repast for the farm-labourer and his
    family, the dish is also (at the commencement
    of the bean season) to be met with at the tables
    of the wealthy. The aroma of the flower of the
    broad bean was once compared, in one of John
    Leech&rsquo;s studies in <i>Punch</i>, to &ldquo;the most delicious
    &rsquo;air oil,&rdquo; but, apart from this fragrance, there is but
    little sentiment about the <i>Faba vulgaris</i>. A much
    more graceful vegetable is the <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>,
    the kidney, or, as the idiotic French call it, the <i>haricot</i> bean. It is just as sensible to call a leg
    of Welsh mutton a <i>pré salé</i>, or salt meadow.
    No well-behaved hashed venison introduces
    himself to our notice unless accompanied by a
    dish of kidney beans. And few people in Europe
    besides Frenchmen and convicts eat the dried
    seeds of this form of bean, which is frequently
    sown in suburban gardens to form a fence to
    keep out cats. But the suburban cat knows a
    trick worth a dozen of that one; and no bean
    that was ever born will arrest his progress, or
    turn him from his evil ways. It is criminal to
    smother the kidney bean with melted butter at
    table. A little oil, vinegar, and pepper agree
    with him much better.</p>
<p>In the great continent of America, the kidney-bean
    seed, dried, is freely partaken of. Pork and
    &ldquo;Borston&rdquo; beans, in fact, form the national dish,
    and right good it is. But do not attempt any
    violent exercise after eating the same. The
    Mexicans are the largest bean-eaters in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> world. They fry the vegetables in oil or stew
    them with peppers and onions, and these <i>frijoles</i> form the principal sustenance of the lower orders.
    An English &ldquo;bean feast&rdquo; (Vulg. <i>beano</i>) is a feast
    at which no beans, and not many other things, are
    eaten. The intelligent foreigner may take it that <i>beano</i> simply means the worship of Bacchus.</p>
<p>With the exception of the onion there is no
    more useful aid to cookery of all sorts than the
    lowly carrot, which was introduced into England&mdash;no,
    not by the Romans&mdash;from Holland, in the
    sixteenth century. And the ladies who attended
    the court of Charles I. were in the habit of wearing
    carrot leaves in the hair, and on their court
    robes, instead of feathers. A similar fashion
    might be revived at the present epoch, with
    advantage to the banking account of vile man.</p>
<p>As the Flemish gardeners brought over the
    roots, we should not despise carrots cooked in the <span class="smcap">Flemish</span> way. Simmer some young carrots in
    butter, with pepper and salt. Add cream (or
    milk and yolk of eggs), a pinch of sugar, and a
    little chopped parsley.</p>
<p>H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, according to
    report, invariably eats carrot soup on the 26th of
    August. The French call it &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Crécy</span>&rdquo; soup,
    because their best carrots grow there; and Crécy
    it may be remembered was also the scene of a
    great battle, when one Englishman proved better
    than five Frenchmen. In this battle the Black
    Prince performed prodigies of valour, afterwards
    assuming the crest of the late Bohemian King&mdash;three
    ostrich feathers (surely these should be
    carrot tops?) with the motto &ldquo;<i>Ich Dien</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Crécy Soup.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Place a mirepoix of white wine in the pot, and
        put a quantity of sliced carrots atop. Moisten with
        broth, and keep simmering till the carrots are done.
        Then pour into a mortar, pound, and pass through
        a tammy. Thin it with more broth, sweeten in
        the proportion of one tablespoonful of sugar to two
        gallons of soup; heat up, pop a little butter in at the
        finish, and in serving it add either small cubes of fried
        bread, or rice boiled as for curry (see page 145).</p>

<p>It is one of the most exasperating laws and
    ordinations of Nature that the nicest things shall
    last the shortest time. &ldquo;Whom the gods love
    die young,&rdquo; is an ancient proverb; and the produce
    of the garden which is most agreeable to
    man invariably gives out too soon. Look at peas.
    Every gardener of worth puts in the seed so that
    you may get the different rows of marrow-fats and
    telephones and <i>ne plus ultras</i> in &ldquo;succession&rdquo;;
    and up they all come, at one and the same time,
    whilst, if you fail to pick them all at once, the
    combined efforts of mildew and the sun will soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> save you the labour of picking them at all. Look
    at strawberries; and why can&rsquo;t they stay in our
    midst all the year round, like the various members
    of the cabbage family?</p>
<p>Then look at <span class="smcap">Asparagus</span>. The gardener
    who could persuade the heads of this department
    to pop up in succession, from January to
    December would earn more money than the
    Prime Minister. The favourite vegetable of the
    ancient Romans was introduced by them, with
    their accustomed unselfishness, into Britain, where
    it has since flourished&mdash;more particularly in the
    alluvial soil of the Thames valley in the neighbourhood
    of Mortlake and Richmond, ground which
    is also especially favourable to the growth of
    celery. In an ancient work called <i>De Re Rustica</i>,
    Cato the Elder, who was born 234 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, has much
    to say&mdash;far more, indeed, than I can translate
    without the aid of a dictionary or &ldquo;crib&rdquo;&mdash;about
    the virtues and proper cultivation of asparagus;
    and Pliny, another noble Roman, devotes several
    chapters of his <i>Natural History</i> (published at the
    commencement of the Christian era) to the same
    subject. &ldquo;Of all the productions of your garden&rdquo;
    says this Mr. Pliny, &ldquo;your chief care will be your
    asparagus.&rdquo; And the cheerful and sanguine
    householder of to-day who sows his asparagus,
    and expects to get it &ldquo;while he waits&rdquo; has ample
    consolation for disappointment in the reflection
    that his labours will benefit posterity, if not the
    next tenant.</p>
<p>The foreigners can beat us for size, in the
    matter of asparagus; but ours is a long way in
    front for flavour. In France the vegetable is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> very largely grown at Argenteuil on the Seine, a
    district which has also produced, and still produces,
    a wine which is almost as dangerous to man
    as hydrocyanic acid, and which was invariably
    served in the restaurants, after the sitting had been
    a lengthy one, no matter what special brand
    might have been ordered. English hosts play the
    same game with their &ldquo;military&rdquo; ports and
    inferior sherries. The Argenteuil asparagus is
    now grown between the vines&mdash;at least 1000
    acres are in cultivation&mdash;hence the peculiar flavour
    which, however grateful it may be to Frenchmen,
    is somewhat sickly and not to be compared with
    that of the &ldquo;little gentleman in Green,&rdquo; nearly
    the whole of whom we English can consume
    with safety to digestion.</p>
<p>According to Greek mythology, asparagus
    grew in the Elysian fields; but whether the
    blessed took oil and vinegar with it, or the &ldquo;bill-sticker&rsquo;s
    paste,&rdquo; so favoured in middle-class
    kitchens of to-day, there is no record. It goes
    best, however, with a plain salad dressing&mdash;a
    &ldquo;spot&rdquo; of mustard worked into a tablespoonful
    of oil, and a dessert-spoonful of tarragon vinegar,
    with pepper and salt <i>ad lib</i>.</p>
<p>Asparagus is no longer known in the British
    pharmacop&#339;ia, but the French make large medicinal
    use of its root, which is supposed to still
    the action of the heart, like foxglove, and to act
    as a preventive of calculi. In cooking the
    vegetable, tie in small bundles, which should be
    stood on end in the saucepan, so that the delicate
    heads should be <i>steamed</i>, and not touched by the
    boiling water. Many cooks will contest this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> point; which, however, does not admit of argument.</p>
<p>There was once a discussion in a well-known
    hostelry, as to whether the</p>

<p>was a fruit or a vegetable. Eventually the head-waiter
    was invited to solve the great question.
    He did so on the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tumarter, sir? Tumarter&rsquo;s a hextra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as a &ldquo;hextra&rdquo; it has never since that
    period ceased to be regarded. A native of South
    America, the plant was introduced into Europe
    by the Spaniards, late in the sixteenth century,
    and the English got it in 1596. Still until a
    quarter of a century ago the tomato has not been
    largely cultivated, save by the market gardener;
    in fact in private gardens it was conspicuous by
    its absence. Those who eat it do <i>not</i> invariably
    succumb to cancer; and the dyspeptic should
    always keep it on the premises. As the tomato
    is also known as the &ldquo;love-apple,&rdquo; a great point
    was missed by our old friend Sergeant Buzfuz,
    in the celebrated Bardell v. Pickwick trial, when
    referring to the postscript, &ldquo;chops, and tomato
    sauce.&rdquo; Possibly Charles Dickens was not an
    authority on veget&mdash;&mdash; I beg pardon, &ldquo;hextras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is a French recipe for</p>
<h4><i>Tomate au Gratin</i>:</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Cut open the tops and scoop out the pulp. Pass
        it through a sieve, to clear away the pips, and mix
        with it either a modicum of butter, or oil, some
        chopped shalot and garlic, with pepper and salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> Simmer the mixture for a quarter of an hour, then
        stir in some bread-crumbs, previously soaked in broth,
        and some yolks of egg. When cold, fill the tomato
        skins with the mixture, shake some fine bread raspings
        over each, and bake in quick oven for ten or
        twelve minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The</p>
<h4><i>Turnip</i></h4>
<p>is not, as might be sometimes imagined, entirely
    composed of compressed deal splinters, but is a
    vegetable which was cultivated in India long
    before the Britons got it. The Scotch call
    turnips &ldquo;neeps&rdquo;; but the Scotch will do anything.
    Probably no member of the vegetable
    family is so great a favourite with the insect
    pests sent on earth by an all-wise Providence
    to prevent mankind having too much to eat.
    But see that you get a few turnips to cook when
    there is roast duck for dinner.</p>
<h4><i>Spinach</i></h4>
<p>was introduced into Spain by the Arabs, and as
    neither nation possessed at that time, at all
    events, the attribute of extra-cleanliness, they
    must have eaten a great deal of &ldquo;matter in the
    wrong place,&rdquo; otherwise known as dirt. For if
    ever there was a vegetable the preparation of
    which for table would justify any cook in giving
    notice to leave, it is spinach.</p>
<p>The Germans have nick-named it &ldquo;stomach-brush,&rdquo;
    and there is no plant growing which
    conduces more to the health of man. But there
    has been more trouble over the proper way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> serve it at table than over Armenia. The French
    chop up their <i>épinards</i> and mix butter, or gravy,
    with the mess. Many English, on the other
    hand, prefer the leaves cooked whole. It is all
    a matter of taste.</p>
<p>But I seem to scent a soft, sweet fragrance
    in the air, a homely and health-giving reek,
    which warns me that I have too long neglected
    to touch upon the many virtues of the</p>
<h4><i>Onion</i>.</h4>
<p>Indigenous to India in the form of</p>
<h4><i>Garlic</i></h4>
<p>(or <i>gar-leek</i>, the original onion), the Egyptians
    got hold of the tear-provoker and cultivated it
    2000 years before the Christian era. So that
    few of the mortals of whom we have ever read
    can have been ignorant of the uses of the onion,
    or <i>gar-leek</i>. But knowledge and practice have
    enabled modern gardeners to produce larger bulbs
    than even the most imaginative of the ancients
    can have dreamt of. To mention all the uses
    to which the onion is put in the kitchen would
    be to write a book too weighty for any known
    motive power to convey to the British Museum;
    but it may be briefly observed of the juice of
    the <i>Cepa</i> that it is invaluable for almost any
    purpose, from flavouring a dish fit to set before
    a king, to the alleviation of the inflammation
    caused by the poison-bearing needle which the
    restless wasp keeps for use within his, or her, tail.
    In fact, the inhabited portion of the globe had
    better be without noses than without onions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p>Like the tomato, <span class="smcap">Celery</span> is a &ldquo;hextra&rdquo;&mdash;and
    a very important one. If you buy the heads at
    half-a-crown per hundred and sell them at threepence
    a portion, it will not exercise your calculating
    powers to discover the profits which can
    be made out of this simple root. Celery is
    simply cultivated &ldquo;smallage&rdquo;; a weed which
    has existed in Britain since the age of ice. It
    was the Italians who made the discovery that
    educated smallage would become celery; and it
    is worthy of note that their forefathers, the
    conquerors of the world, with the Greeks, seem
    to have known &ldquo;no touch of it&rdquo;&mdash;as a relish, at
    all events; though some writers will have it that
    the &ldquo;Apium,&rdquo; with which the victors at the
    Isthmian and other games were crowned was
    not parsley but the leaf of the celery plant. But
    what does it matter? Celery is invaluable as a
    flavourer, and when properly cultivated, and not
    stringy, a most delightful and satisfactory substance
    to bite. In fact a pretty woman never
    shows to more advantage than when nibbling a
    crisp, &ldquo;short&rdquo; head of celery&mdash;provided she
    possess pretty teeth.</p>
<p>With boiled turkey, or ditto pheasant, celery
    sauce is <i>de rigueur</i>; and it should be flavoured
    slightly with slices of onion, an ounce of butter
    being allowed to every head of celery. The
    French are fond of it stewed; and as long as the
    flavour of the gravy, or <i>jus</i>, does not disguise the
    flavour of the celery, it is excellent when thus
    treated. Its merits in a salad will be touched
    upon in another chapter.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Parsnip</span> is a native of England, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> it is chiefly used to make an inferior kind of
    spirit, or a dreadful brand of wine. Otherwise
    few people would trouble to cultivate the parsnip;
    for we can&rsquo;t be having boiled pork or salt
    fish for dinner every day. The <span class="smcap">Vegetable
    Marrow</span> is a member of the pumpkin family and
    is a comparatively tasteless occupant of the
    garden, its appearance in which heralds the
    departure of summer. In the suburbs, if you
    want to annoy the people next door, you cannot
    do better than put in a marrow plant or two.
    If they come to anything, and get plenty of
    water, they will crawl all over your neighbour&rsquo;s
    premises; and unless he is fond of the breed,
    and cuts and cooks them, they make him mad.
    The frugal housewife, blessed with a large
    family, makes jam of the surplus marrows; but
    I prefer a conserve of apricot, gooseberry, or
    greengage. Another purpose to which to put
    this vegetable is&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Scoop out the seeds, after cutting it in half,
        lengthways. Fill the space with minced veal
        (cooked), small cubes of bacon, and plenty of seasoning&mdash;some
        people add the yoke of an egg&mdash;put on
        the other half marrow, and bake for half-an-hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <span class="smcap">Baked Marrow</span> is a cheap and homely
    dish which, like many another savoury dish,
    seldom finds its way to the rich man&rsquo;s dining-room.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Artichoke</span> is a species of thistle; and
    the man who pays the usual high-toned restaurant
    prices for the pleasure of eating such insipid
    food, is an&mdash;never mind what. Boil the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> in salt and water, and dip the ends of the leaves
    in oil and vinegar, or Holland sauce, before
    eating. Then you will enjoy the really fine
    flavour of the&mdash;oil and vinegar, or Holland
    sauce.</p>
<p>The so-called <span class="smcap">Jerusalem Artichoke</span> is
    really a species of sunflower. Its tuber is not a
    universal favourite, though it possesses far from a
    coarse flavour. The plant has nothing whatever
    to do with Jerusalem, and never had. Put a
    tuber or two into your garden, and you will
    have Jerusalem artichokes as long as you live on
    those premises. For the vegetable will stay with
    you as long as the gout, or the rate-gatherer.
    Pheasants are particularly partial to this sort of
    crop.</p>
<p>By far the best vegetable production of the
    gorgeous East is the</p>
<h4><i>Brinjal</i></h4>
<p>&rsquo;Tis oval in shape, and about the size of a hen&rsquo;s
    egg, the surface being purple in colour. It is
    usually cut in twain and done &ldquo;on the grating&rdquo;;
    I have met something very like the <i>brinjal</i> in
    Covent Garden; but can find no record of the
    vegetable&rsquo;s pedigree in any book.</p>
<p>Although there are still many vegetarian
    restaurants in our large towns, the prejudice
    against animal food is, happily, dying out; and
    if ridicule could kill, we should not hear much
    more of the &ldquo;cranks&rdquo; who with delightful
    inconsistency, would spurn a collop of beef,
    and gorge themselves on milk, in every shape
    and form. If milk, butter, and cheese be not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> animal food I should like to know what is?
    And it is as reasonable to ask a man to sustain
    life on dried peas and mushrooms as to feed a
    tiger on cabbages.</p>
<p>Once, and only once, has the writer attempted a</p>
<h4><i>Vegetarian Banquet</i>.</h4>
<p>It was savoury enough; and possessed the
    additional merit of being cheap. Decidedly
    &ldquo;filling at the price&rdquo; was that meal. We&mdash;I
    had a messmate&mdash;commenced with (alleged)
    Scotch broth&mdash;which consisted principally of
    dried peas, pearl barley, and oatmeal&mdash;and a large
    slice of really excellent brown bread was served,
    to each, with this broth. Thereupon followed a
    savoury stew of onions and tomatoes, relieved by
    a &ldquo;savoury pie,&rdquo; apparently made from potatoes,
    leeks, bread crumbs, butter, and &ldquo;postponed&rdquo;
    mushrooms. We had &ldquo;gone straight&rdquo; up to now,
    but both shied a bit at the maccaroni and grated
    cheese. We had two bottles of ginger beer
    apiece, with this dinner, which cost less than
    three shillings for the two, after the dapper little
    waitress had been feed. On leaving, we both
    agreed to visit that cleanly and well-ordered
    little house again, if only from motives of
    economy; but within half an hour that programme
    was changed.</p>
<p>Like the old lady at the tea-drinking, I
    commenced to &ldquo;swell wisibly&rdquo;; and so did my
    companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon alive!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I feel just for all
    the wor-rld like a captive balloon, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> puffy-dunter&mdash;that&rsquo;s a puffing whale, ye ken. I&rsquo;ll
    veesit yon onion-hoose nae mair i&rsquo; ma life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I think it cost us something like half a
    sovereign in old brandy to neutralise the effects
    of that vegetarian banquet.</p>

<p>The poor Indian grinds his coriander seeds, green
    ginger, and other ingredients between two large
    flat stones; taking a whiff at the family &ldquo;hubble-bubble&rdquo;
    pipe at intervals. The frugal British
    housewife purchases (alleged) curry powder in
    the warehouse of Italy&mdash;where it may have lived
    on, like Claudian, &ldquo;through the centuries&rdquo;&mdash;stirs
    a spoonful or two into the hashed mutton,
    surrounds it with a wall of clammy rice, and calls
    it <span class="smcap">Benares Curry</span>, made from the recipe of a
    very dear uncle who met his death while tiger-shooting.
    And you will be in the minority if
    you do not cut this savoury meat with a knife,
    and eat potatoes, and very often cabbage, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> it. The far-seeing eating-house keeper corrals a <i>Lascar</i> or a discharged <i>Mehtar</i> into the firm,
    gives him his board, a pound a month, and a
    clean <i>puggaree</i> and <i>Kummerbund</i> daily, and &ldquo;stars&rdquo;
    him in the bill as an &ldquo;Indian <i>chef</i>, fresh from the
    Chowringhee Club, Calcutta.&rdquo; And it is part
    of the duties of this Oriental&mdash;supposed by the
    unwary to be at least a prince in his native land&mdash;to
    hand the portions of curry, which he may
    or may not have concocted, to the appreciative
    guests, who enjoy the repast all the more from
    having the scent of the Hooghly brought across
    the footlights. I was once sadly and solemnly
    reproved by the head waiter of a very &ldquo;swagger&rdquo;
    establishment indeed for sending away, after one
    little taste, the (alleged) curry which had been
    handed me by an exile from Ind, in snow-white
    raiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really ought to have eaten that, sir,&rdquo;
    said the waiter, &ldquo;for that man&rsquo;s family have been
    celebrated curry-makers for generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smole a broad smile. In the Land of the
    Moguls the very babies who roll in the dust
    know the secret of curry-making. But that
    &ldquo;that man&rdquo; had had any hand in the horrible
    concoction placed before me I still resolutely
    decline to believe. And how can a man be
    cook and waiter at the same time? The &ldquo;native
    curry-maker,&rdquo; depend on it, is more or less of a
    fraud; and his aid is only invoked as an excuse
    for overcharging.</p>
<p>At the Oriental Club are served, or used to be
    served, really excellent curries, assorted; for as
    there be more ways than one of killing a cat, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> are there more curries than one. The French
    turn out a horrible mixture, with parsley and
    mushrooms in it, which they call <i>kari</i>; it is
    called by a still worse name on the Boulevards,
    and the children of our lively neighbours are
    frequently threatened with it by their nurses.</p>
<p>On the whole, the East Indian method is the
    best; and the most philanthropic curry I ever
    tasted was one which my own <i>Khitmughar</i> had
    just prepared, with infinite pains, for his own
    consumption. The poor heathen had prospected
    a feast, as it was one of his numerous &ldquo;big
    days&rdquo;; so, despising the homely <i>dhal</i>, on the
    which, with a plate of rice and a modicum of
    rancid butter, he was wont to sustain existence,
    he had manufactured a savoury mess of pottage,
    the looks of which gratified me. So, at the risk
    of starting another Mutiny, it was ordained that
    the slave should serve the refection at the table
    of the &ldquo;protector of the poor.&rdquo; And a <i>pukkha</i> curry it was, too. Another dish of native
    manufacture with which the writer became
    acquainted was a</p>
<h4><i>Parsee Curry</i>.</h4>
<p>The eminent firm of Jehangeer on one occasion
    presented a petition to the commanding-officer
    that they might be allowed to supply a special
    curry to the mess one guest-night. The request
    was probably made as an inducement to some of
    the young officers to pay a little on account of
    their &ldquo;owings&rdquo; to the firm; but it is to be
    feared that no special vote of thanks followed the
    sampling of that special curry. It was a curry!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> I tasted it for a week (as the Frenchman did
    the soup of Swindon); and the Parsee <i>chef</i> must have upset the entire contents of the spice-box
    into it. I never felt more like murder than
    when the hotel cook in Manchester put nutmeg
    in the oyster sauce; but after that curry, the
    strangling of the entire firm of Jehangeer would,
    in our cantonments, at all events, have been
    brought in &ldquo;justifiable homicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oyster sauce&rdquo; recalls a quaint <i>simile</i> I once
    heard a bookmaker make use of. He was talking
    of one of his aristocratic debtors, whom he described
    as sure to pay up, if you could only get
    hold of him. &ldquo;But mark you,&rdquo; continued the
    layer of odds, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s just about as easy to get
    hold of as <i>the oyster in the sauce</i>, at one of our
    moonicipal banquets!&rdquo; But return we to our
    coriander seeds. There is absolutely no reason
    why the frugal housewife in this country should
    not make her own curry powder from day to
    day, as it may be required. Here is an average
    Indian recipe; but it must be remembered that
    in the gorgeous East tastes vary as much as
    elsewhere, and that Bengal, Bombay, Madras
    (including Burmah), Ceylon, and the Straits
    Settlements, have all different methods of preparing
    a curry.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A few coriander and cumin seeds&mdash;according to
        taste&mdash;eight peppercorns, a small piece of turmeric,
        and one dried chili, all pounded together.</p>
    <p>When making the curry <i>mixture</i>, take a piece of
        the heart of a cabbage, the size of a hen&rsquo;s egg; chop
        it fine and add one sour apple in thin slices the size
        of a Keswick codlin, the juice of a medium-sized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> lemon, a salt-spoonful of black pepper, and a tablespoonful
        of the above curry powder. Mix all well
        together; then take six medium-sized onions which
        have been chopped small and fried a delicate brown,
        a clove of garlic, also chopped small, two ounces of
        fresh butter, two ounces of flour, and one pint of
        beef gravy. Boil up this lot (which commences
        with the onions), and <i>when boiling</i> stir in the rest of
        the mixture. Let it all simmer down, and then
        add the solid part of the curry, <i>i.e.</i> the meat, cut
        in portions not larger than two inches square.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember, O frugal housewife, that the
    turmeric portion of the entertainment should be
    added with a niggard hand. &ldquo;Too much turmeric&rdquo;
    is the fault which is found with most
    curries made in England. I remember, when a
    boy, that there was an idea rooted in my mind
    that curries were made with Doctor Gregory&rsquo;s
    Powder, an unsavoury drug with which we were
    periodically regaled by the head nurse; and there
    was always a fierce conflict at the dinner-table
    when the bill-of-fare included this (as we supposed)
    physic-al terror. But it was simply the taste of
    turmeric to which we took exception.</p>
<p>What is <span class="smcap">Turmeric</span>? A plant in cultivation
    all over India, whose tubers yield a deep yellow
    powder of a resinous nature. This resinous
    powder is sold in lumps, and is largely used for
    adulterating mustard; just as inferior anchovy
    sauce is principally composed of Armenian Bole,
    the deep red powder with which the actor makes
    up his countenance. Turmeric is also used
    medicinally in Hindustan, but not this side of
    Suez, although in chemistry it affords an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> infallible test for the presence of alkalies. The <span class="smcap">Coriander</span> has become naturalised in parts of
    England, but is more used on the Continent.
    Our confectioners put the seeds in cakes and
    buns, also comfits, and in Germany, Norway,
    Sweden, and (I fancy) Russia, they figure in
    household bread. In the south of England,
    coriander and caraway seeds are sown side by
    side, and crops of each are obtained in alternate
    years. The coriander seed, too, is largely used
    with that of the caraway and the cumin, for
    making the liqueur known as <span class="smcap">Kümmel</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cumin</span> is mentioned in Scripture as something
    particularly nice. The seeds are sweet-savoured,
    something like those of the caraway, but more
    potent. In Germany they put them into bread,
    and the Dutch use them to flavour their cheeses.
    The seeds we get in England come principally
    from Sicily and Malta.</p>
<p>And now that my readers know all about the
    ingredients of curry-powder&mdash;it is assumed that
    no analysis of the chili, the ginger-root, or the
    peppercorn, is needed&mdash;let them emulate the pupils
    of Mr. Wackford Squeers, and &ldquo;go and do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Another Recipe</span> for curry-powder includes
    fenugreek, cardamoms, allspice, and cloves; but
    I verily believe that this was the powder used in
    that abominable Parsee hell-broth, above alluded
    to, so it should be cautiously approached, if at all.
    &ldquo;Fenugreek&rdquo; sounds evil; and I should say a
    curry compounded of the above ingredients
    would taste like a &ldquo;Number One&rdquo; pick-me-up.
    Yet another recipe (<span class="smcap">Doctor Kitchener&rsquo;s</span>)
    specifies six ounces of coriander seed, five ounces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> of turmeric (<i>ower muckle, I&rsquo;m of opeenion</i>) two
    ounces each of black pepper and mustard seed
    (<i>ochone!</i>), half an ounce of cumin seed, half an
    ounce of cinnamon (<i>donner und blitzen!</i>), and
    one ounce of lesser cardamoms. All these things
    are to be placed in a cool oven, kept therein one
    night, and pounded in a marble mortar next
    morning, preparatory to being rubbed through a
    sieve. &ldquo;Kitchener&rdquo; sounds like a good cooking
    name; but, with all due respect, I am not going
    to recommend his curry-powder.</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">Malay curry</span> is made with blanched
    almonds, which should be fried in butter till
    lightly browned. Then pound them to a paste
    with a sliced onion and some thin lemon-rind.
    Curry powder and gravy are added, and a small
    quantity of cream. The Malays curry all sorts
    of fish, flesh, and fowl, including the young
    shoots of the bamboo&mdash;and nice tender, succulent
    morsels they are. At a hotel overlooking the
    harbour of Point de Galle, Ceylon, &ldquo;run,&rdquo; at
    the time of the writer&rsquo;s visit, by a most convivial
    and enterprising Yankee, a canning concocter of
    all sorts of &ldquo;slings&rdquo; and &ldquo;cocktails,&rdquo; there used
    to be quite a plethora of curries in the bill-of-fare.
    But for a prawn curry there is no place like the
    City of Palaces. And the reason for this super-excellence
    is that the prawns&mdash;but that story had,
    perhaps, best remain untold.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Curried Locusts</span> formed one of the most
    eccentric dishes ever tasted by the writer. There
    had come upon us that day a plague of these all-devouring
    insects. A few billions called on us,
    in our kitchen gardens, in passing; and whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> they ate up every green thing&mdash;including the
    newly-painted wheelbarrow, and the regimental
    standard, which had been incautiously left out of
    doors&mdash;our faithful blacks managed to capture
    several <i>impis</i> of the marauding scuts, in revenge;
    and the mess-cook made a right savoury <i>plât</i> of
    their hind-quarters.</p>
<p>It is criminal to serve curry during the <i>entrée</i> period of dinner. And it is worse form still to
    hand it round after gooseberry tart and cream,
    and trifle, as I have seen done at one great house.
    In the land of its birth, the spicy pottage invariably
    precedes the sweets. Nubbee Bux marches
    solemnly round with the mixture, in a deep dish,
    and is succeeded by Ram Lal with the rice.
    And in the Madras Presidency, where <i>dry</i> curry
    is served as well as the other brand, there is a
    procession of three brown attendants. Highly-seasoned
    dishes at the commencement of a long
    meal are a mistake; and this is one of the reasons
    why I prefer the middle cut of a plain-boiled
    Tay salmon, or the tit-bit of a lordly turbot, or
    a flake or two of a Grimsby cod, to a <i>sole
    Normande</i>, or a red mullet stewed with garlic,
    mushrooms, and inferior claret. I have even met <i>homard à l&rsquo;Américaine</i>, during the fish course, at
    the special request of a well-known Duke. The
    soup, too, eaten at a large dinner should be as
    plain as possible; the edge being fairly taken off
    the appetite by such concoctions as <i>bisque</i>, <i>bouillabaisse</i>,
    and <i>mulligatawny</i>&mdash;all savoury and tasty
    dishes, but each a meal in itself. Then I maintain
    that to curry whitebait is wrong; partly
    because curry should on no account be served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> before roast and boiled, and partly because the
    flavour of the whitebait is too delicate for the
    fish to be clad in spices and onions. The lesson
    which all dinner-givers ought to have learnt from
    the Ancient Romans&mdash;the first people on record
    who went in for æsthetic cookery&mdash;is that highly-seasoned
    and well-peppered dishes should figure
    at the end, and not the commencement of a
    banquet. Here follows a list of some of the
    productions of Nature which it is allowable to
    curry.</p>
<h4><i>What to Curry.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p><span class="smcap">Turbot. Sole. Cod.</span></p>
    <p><span class="smcap">Lobster. Crayfish. Prawns</span>,&mdash;but <i>not</i> the so-called
        &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dublin Prawn</span>,&rdquo; which is delicious when
        eaten plain boiled, but no good in a curry.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A mistaken notion has prevailed for some time
    amongst men and women who write books, that
    the Indian curry mixture is almost red-hot to the
    taste. As a matter of fact it is of a far milder
    nature than many I have tasted &ldquo;on this side.&rdquo;
    Also the Anglo-Indian does not sustain life
    entirely on food flavoured with turmeric and garlic.
    In fact, during a stay of seven years in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> gorgeous East, the writer&rsquo;s experience was that
    not one in ten touched curry at the dinner table.
    At second breakfast&mdash;otherwise known as &ldquo;tiffin&rdquo;&mdash;it
    was a favoured dish; but the stuff prepared
    for the meal of the day&mdash;or the bulk thereof&mdash;usually
    went to gratify the voracious appetite of
    the &ldquo;<i>mehters</i>,&rdquo; the Hindus who swept out the
    mess-rooms, and whose lowness of &ldquo;caste&rdquo;
    allowed them to eat &ldquo;anything.&rdquo; An eccentric
    meal was the <i>mehter&rsquo;s</i> dinner. Into the empty
    preserved-meat tin which he brought round to
    the back door I have seen emptied such assorted <i>pabulum</i> as mock turtle soup, lobster salad, plum
    pudding and custard, curry, and (of course), the
    surplus <i>vilolif</i>; and in a few seconds he was
    squatting on his heels, and spading into the
    mixture with both hands.</p>
<p>In the Bengal Presidency cocoa-nut is freely
    used with a curry dressing; and as some men have
    as great a horror of this addition, as of oil in a
    salad, it is as well to consult the tastes of your
    guests beforehand.</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">Prawn Curry</span> I have seen made in
    Calcutta as follows, the proportions of spices,
    etc., being specially written down by a <i>munshi</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Pound and mix one tablespoonful of coriander
        seed, one tablespoonful of poppy seed, a salt-spoonful
        of turmeric, half a salt-spoonful of cumin seed, a pinch
        of ground cinnamon, a ditto of ground nutmeg, a small
        lump of ginger, and one salt-spoonful of salt. Mix
        this with butter, add two sliced onions, and fry till
        lightly browned. Add the prawns, shelled, and pour
        in the milk of a cocoa-nut. Simmer for twenty
        minutes, and add some lime juice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>But the champion of curries ever sampled by
    the writer was a dry curry&mdash;a decided improvement
    on those usually served in the Madras
    Presidency&mdash;and the recipe (which has been
    already published in the <i>Sporting Times</i> and <i>Lady&rsquo;s Pictorial</i>), only came into the writer&rsquo;s
    possession some years after he had quitted the
    land of temples.</p>
<h4><i>Dry Curry.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <div style="margin-left:5%">
        <p> 1 lb. of meat (mutton, fowl, or white fish).<br />
            1 lb. of onions.<br />
            1 clove of garlic.<br />
            2 ounces of butter.<br />
            1 dessert-spoonful of curry powder.<br />
            1 dessert-spoonful of curry paste.<br />
            1 dessert-spoonful of chutnee (or tamarind preserve,<br />
            according to taste).<br />
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>A very little cassareep, which is a condiment (only
        obtainable at a few London shops) made from the juice
        of the bitter cassava, or manioc root. Cassareep is the
        basis of that favourite West Indian dish &ldquo;Pepper-pot.&rdquo;</p>
    <div style="margin-left:5%">
        <p> Salt to taste.<br />
            A good squeeze of lemon juice. </p>
    </div>
    <p>First brown the onions in the butter, and then
        dry them. Add the garlic, which must be mashed
        to a pulp with the blade of a knife. Then mix the
        powder, paste, chutnee, and cassareep into a thin paste
        with the lemon juice. Mash the dried onions into
        this, and let all cook gently till thoroughly mixed.
        Then add the meat, cut into small cubes, and let all
        simmer very gently for three hours. This sounds a
        long time, but it must be remembered that the recipe
        is for a <i>dry</i> curry; and when served there should be
        no liquid about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&rsquo;Tis a troublesome dish to prepare; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> judging from the flattering communications
    received by the writer, the lieges would seem to
    like it. And the mixture had better be cooked
    in a <i>double</i> or porridge-saucepan, to prevent any
    &ldquo;catching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already, in one of the breakfast chapters, has
    the subject of the preparation of rice, to be served
    with curry, been touched upon; but there will
    be no harm done in giving the directions again.</p>
<h4><i>Rice for Curry</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Soak a sufficiency of rice in cold water until by
        repeated strainings all the dirt is separated from it.
        Then put the rice into <i>boiling</i> water, and let it
        &ldquo;gallop&rdquo; for nine or ten minutes&mdash;<i>no longer</i>. Strain
        the water off through a colander, and dash a little <i>cold</i> water over the rice to separate the grains. Put
        in a hot dish, and serve immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple enough recipe, surely? So let us
    hear no more complaints of stodgy, clammy,
    &ldquo;puddingy&rdquo; rice. Most of the cookery books
    give far more elaborate directions, but the above
    is the method usually pursued by the poor brown
    heathen himself.</p>
<p>Soyer&rsquo;s recipe resembles the above; but, after
    draining the water from the cooked rice, it is replaced
    in the saucepan, the interior of which has
    in the interim been anointed with butter. The
    saucepan is then placed either near the fire (not
    on it), or in a slow oven, for the rice to swell.</p>
<p>Another way:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>After washing the rice, throw it into plenty of
        boiling water&mdash;in the proportion of six pints of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> to one pound of rice. Boil it for five minutes, and
        skim it; then add a wine-glassful of milk for every
        half pound of rice, and continue boiling for five
        minutes longer. Strain the water off through a
        colander, and put it dry into the pot, on the corner
        of the stove, pouring over the rice a small piece of
        butter, which has been melted in a tablespoonful of
        the hot milk and water in which the rice was boiled.
        Add salt, and stir the rice for five minutes more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decayed denizen of the ocean, dried to the
    consistency of biscuit, and known in Hindustan
    as a <span class="smcap">Bombay Duck</span>, which is frequently eaten
    with curry, &ldquo;over yonder,&rdquo; does not find much
    favour, this side of Port Said, although I have
    met the fowl in certain city restaurants. The
    addition is not looked upon with any particular
    favour by the writer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have yet to learn&rdquo; once observed that great
    and good man, the late Doctor Joseph Pope,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to

</blockquote>
<p>If Sydney Smith had only possessed the experience
    of old King Nebuchadnezzar, after he had been
    &ldquo;turned out to grass,&rdquo; the witty prebend might
    not have waxed quite so enthusiastic on the
    subject of &ldquo;herbaceous meat.&rdquo; Still the subject
    is a vast and important one, in its connection
    with gastronomy, and lends itself to poetry far
    easier than doth the little sucking pig, upon
    whom Charles Lamb expended so great and
    unnecessary a wealth of language.</p>
<p>But look at the terse, perfunctory, and far
    from satisfactory manner in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> <i>Encyclopædia</i> attacks the subject. &ldquo;Salad,&rdquo; we read,
    &ldquo;is the term given to a preparation of raw herbs
    for food. It derives its name from the fact that
    salt is one of the chief ingredients used in dressing
    a salad.&rdquo; This statement is not only misleading
    but startling; for in the &ldquo;dressing&rdquo; of a salad it
    would be the act of a lunatic to make salt the
    &ldquo;chief ingredient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long before they had learnt the art of dressing
    the herbs, our ancestors partook of cresses
    (assorted), celery, and lettuces, after being soaked
    in water for a considerable period; and they
    dipped the raw herbs into salt before consuming
    them. In fact, in many a cheap eating-house
    of to-day, the term &ldquo;salad&rdquo; means plain lettuce,
    or cress, or possibly both, absolutely undressed&mdash;in
    a state of nature, <i>plus</i> plenty of dirty water.
    Even the English cook of the end of the nineteenth
    century cannot rid himself, or herself, of
    the idea that lettuce, like water-cress, knows the
    running brook, or the peaceful pond, as its
    natural element. And thirty years before the
    end of that century, a salad bowl was absolutely
    unknown in nine-tenths of the eating-houses of
    Great Britain.</p>
<p>There is no use in blinking the fact that it
    is to our lively neighbours that we owe the
    introduction of the salad proper. Often as the
    writer has been compelled, in these pages, to
    inveigh against the torturing of good fish and
    flesh by the alien cook, and the high prices
    charged for its endowment with an alien flavour,
    let that writer (figuratively) place a crown of
    endive, tipped with baby onions, upon the brows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> of the philanthropist who dressed the first salad,
    and gave the recipe to the world. That recipe
    has, of course, been improved upon; and although
    the <i>savant</i> who writes in the <i>Encyclopædia</i> proclaims
    that &ldquo;salad has always been a favourite
    food with civilised nations, and has varied very
    little in its composition,&rdquo; the accuracy of both
    statements is open to question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every art,&rdquo; observes another writer, &ldquo;has its
    monstrosities; gastronomy has not been behind-hand;
    and though he must be a bold man who
    will venture to blaspheme the elegancies of
    French cookery, there comes a time to every
    Englishman who may have wandered into a
    mistaken admiration of sophisticated messes,
    when he longs for the simple diet of his native
    land, and vows that the best cookery in the
    world, and that which satisfies the most refined
    epicureanism, sets up for its ideal&mdash;plainness of
    good food, and the cultivation of natural tastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet the French have taught us, or tried to
    teach us, how to prepare a dish of raw herbs, in
    the simplest way in the world!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now a salad,&rdquo; says the same writer, &ldquo;is
    simplicity itself, and here is a marvel&mdash;it is the
    crowning grace of a French dinner, while, on the
    other hand, it is little understood and villainously
    treated at English tables.&rdquo; Ahem! I would
    qualify that last statement. At <i>some</i> English
    tables I have tasted salads compared with which
    the happiest effort of the <i>chef</i> deserves not to be
    mentioned in the same garlic-laden breath. And
    &ldquo;garlic-laden breath&rdquo; naturally reminds me of
    the story of Francatelli&mdash;of which anecdote I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> not believe one word, by the way. It was said
    of Franc., whilst <i>chef</i> at the Reform Club, that
    his salads were such masterpieces, such things of
    beauty, that one of the members questioned him
    on the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you manage to introduce such a
    delicious flavour into your salads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that should be my secret,&rdquo; was the
    reply. &ldquo;But I will tell him to you. After I have
    made all my preparations, and the green food is
    mixed with the dressing, I chew a little clove of
    garlic between my teeth&mdash;so&mdash;and then breathe
    gently over the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as observed before, I do not believe that
    garlic story.</p>
<p>O salad, what monstrosities are perpetrated in
    thy name! Let the genteel boarding-house
    cook-maid, the young lady who has studied
    harmony and the higher mathematics at the
    Board School, spread herself over the subject;
    and then invite the angels to inspect the matter,
    and weep! For this is the sort of &ldquo;harmony&rdquo;
    which the &ldquo;paying guest,&rdquo; who can appreciate
    the advantages of young and musical society, an
    airy front bed-chamber, and a bicycle room, is expected
    to enthuse over at the <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i>: a <i>mélange</i> of herbs and roots, including water-cress and giant
    radishes, swimming in equal parts of vinegar and
    oil, and a large proportion of the water in which
    the ingredients have been soaking for hours&mdash;said
    ingredients being minced small, like veal collops,
    with a steel knife. And the same salad, the very
    identical horror, obtrudes itself on the table at
    other genteel establishments than boarding-houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> For they be &ldquo;mostly fools&rdquo; who people the
    civilised world.</p>
<p>Let it be laid down as a golden rule, that the
    concoction of a salad should never, or hardly ever,
    be entrusted to the tender mercies of the British
    serving-maid. For the salad-maker, like the poet,
    is born, not made; and the divine <i>afflatus</i>&mdash;I
    don&rsquo;t mean garlic&mdash;is as essential in the one as
    in the other. We will take the simple mixture,
    what is commonly known as the</p>
<h4><i>French Salad</i>,</h4>
<p>first. This is either composed, in the matter of
    herbs, of lettuce, chopped taragon, chervil, and
    chives; or of endive, with, &ldquo;lurking in the bowl,&rdquo;
    a <i>chapon</i>, or crust of bread on which a clove of
    garlic has been rubbed. But the waiter, an he
    be discreet, will ask the customer beforehand if
    he prefer that the <i>chapon</i> be omitted. The dressing
    is simplicity itself:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Within the bowl of a table-spoon are placed, in
        succession, a spot of made mustard, and a sprinkling
        of black pepper and salt. The bowl is filled up with
        vinegar, and with a fork in the other hand the waiter
        stirs quickly the mustard, etc., afterwards emptying
        the contents of the spoon over the green-stuff. Then
        the spoon is refilled&mdash;either twice or thrice, <i>ad lib.</i>&mdash;with
        Lucca oil, which is also poured over the salad.
        Then the final mixing takes place, in the salad bowl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there be many and elaborate ways of salad-making.
    Here is the writer&rsquo;s idea of a</p>
<h4><i>Lobster Salad</i></h4>
<p>for half-a-dozen guests:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In a soup plate, mix the yolks of two hard-boiled
        eggs&mdash;boiled for thirty minutes, and afterwards
        thrown into cold water&mdash;into a smooth paste with a
        teaspoonful of made mustard, and a tablespoonful of
        plain vinegar, added drop by drop. Keep on stirring,
        and add a dessert-spoonful of tarragon vinegar, a few
        drops of essence of anchovies, a teaspoonful (<i>not
        heaped</i>) of salt, about the same quantity of sifted
        sugar, and a good pinch of cayenne. [The tendency
        of black pepper is to make a salad gritty, which is
        an abomination.] Lastly, add, drop by drop, three
        tablespoonfuls of oil. Pour this dressing (which
        should be in a continual state of stir) into your salad
        bowl. Add the pickings of a hen lobster cut into
        dice, and atop of the lobster, lettuces which have
        been shred with clean fingers, or with ivory forks;
        a little endive may be added, with a slice or two
        of beetroot; but no onion (or very little) in a
        lobster salad. A few shreds of anchovy may be
        placed atop; with beetroot cut into shapes, the
        whites of the eggs, and the coral of the lobster, for the
        sake of effect; but seek not, O student, to achieve
        prettiness of effect to the detriment of practical
        utility. I need hardly add that the sooner after its
        manufacture a salad is eaten, the better will be its
        flavour. And the solid ingredients should only be
        mixed with the dressing at the very last moment;
        otherwise a sodden, flabby effect will be produced,
        which is neither pleasing to the eye, nor calculated
        to promote good digestion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am perfectly aware that the above is not a
    strict <i>Mayonnaise</i> dressing, in which the egg
    yolks should be raw, instead of cooked. But,
    like the Scotsman, I have &ldquo;tried baith,&rdquo; and prefer
    my own way, which more resembles the <i>sauce Tartare</i>, than the <i>Mayonnaise</i> of our lively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> neighbours, who, by the way, merely wipe, instead
    of wash, their lettuces and endive, to
    preserve, as they say, the flavour. Of course
    this is a matter of taste, but the writer must own
    to a preference for the baptised article, which must,
    however, on no account be left to soak, but be
    simply freed from dirt, grit, and&mdash;other things.</p>
<p>What is the origin of the word &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mayonnaise</span>&rdquo;?
    No two Frenchmen will give you the
    same answer. &ldquo;Of or belonging to Mayonne&rdquo;
    would seem to be the meaning of the word; but
    then there is no such place as Mayonne in the
    whole of France. Grimod de la Reyniere maintained
    that the proper word was &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Bayonnaise</span>,&rdquo;
    meaning a native of Bayonne, on the Spanish
    frontier. Afterwards Grimod, who was a
    resourceful man, got hold of another idea, and
    said that the word was probably &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mahonnaise</span>,&rdquo;
    and so named in honour of Marshal Richelieu&rsquo;s
    capture of the stronghold of Mahon, in the
    island of Minorca. But what had this victory
    got to do with a salad dressing? What was the
    connection of raw eggs and tarragon vinegar with
    Marshal Richelieu? Then up came another
    cook, in the person of Carême, who established
    it as an absolute certainty that the genuine word
    was &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Magnonnaise</span>,&rdquo; from the word &ldquo;<i>manier</i>,&rdquo;
    to manipulate. But as nobody would stand this
    definition for long, a fresh search had to be
    made; and this time an old Provençal verb was
    dug up&mdash;<i>mahonner</i>, or more correctly <i>maghonner</i>,
    to worry or fatigue. And this is now said
    by purists to be the source of <i>Mayonnaise</i>&mdash;&ldquo;something
    worried,&rdquo; or fatigued. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> reason for the gender of the noun is said to be
    that in ancient times lovely woman was accustomed
    to manipulate the salad with her own fair
    fingers. In the time of Rousseau, the phrase <i>retourner la salade avec les doigts</i> was used to
    describe a woman as being still young and
    beautiful; just as in Yorkshire at the present
    time, &ldquo;she canna mak&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; bread&rdquo; is used to
    describe a woman who is of no possible use in the
    house. So a <i>Mayonnaise</i> or a <i>Mahonnaise</i>&mdash;I care
    not which be the correct spelling&mdash;was a young
    lady who &ldquo;fatigued&rdquo; the salad. More shame to
    the gallants of the day, who allowed &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo;
    to be associated with youth and beauty!</p>
<p>But can it possibly matter what the word
    means, when the mixture is smooth and savoury;
    and so deftly blended that no one flavour
    predominates? And herein lies the secret of
    every mixture used for the refreshment of the
    inner man and woman; whether it be a soup,
    a curry, a trifle, a punch, or a cup&mdash;no one
    ingredient should be of more weight or importance
    than another. And that was the secret
    of the &ldquo;delicious gravy&rdquo; furnished by the celebrated
    stew at the &ldquo;Jolly Farmers,&rdquo; in <i>The
    Old Curiosity Shop</i> of Charles Dickens.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mayonnaise</span> (we will drop for the nonce,
    the other spelling) is made thus:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the proportions of two egg yolks to half a
        pint of Lucca oil, and a small wine-glassful of tarragon
        vinegar. Work the yolks smooth in a basin, with a
        seasoning of pepper (cayenne for choice), salt, and&mdash;according
        to the writer&rsquo;s views&mdash;sifted sugar.
        Then a few drops of oil, and fewer of vinegar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> stirring the mixture all the time, from right to left,
        with a wooden, or ivory, spoon. In good truth &rsquo;tis
        a &ldquo;fatiguing&rdquo; task; and as in very hot weather the
        sauce is liable to decompose, or &ldquo;curdle,&rdquo; before the
        finishing touches are put to it, it may be made over
        ice.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<p>is the motto for the <i>Mayonnaise</i>-mixer. And
    in many cases her only reward consists in the
    knowledge that through her art and patience
    she has helped to make the sojourn of others
    in this vale of tears less tearful and monotonous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Onion atoms&rdquo; should &ldquo;lurk within the
    bowl,&rdquo; on nearly every occasion, and as for a
    potato salad&mdash;don&rsquo;t be afraid, I&rsquo;m not going to
    quote any more Sydney Smith, so don&rsquo;t get
    loading your guns&mdash;well, here is the proper way
    to make it.</p>
<h4><i>Potato Salad.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Cut nine or ten average-sized kidney potatoes
        (cooked) into slices, half an inch thick, put them in
        a salad bowl, and pour over them, after mixing, two
        tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one tablespoonful of tarragon
        vinegar, six tablespoonfuls of oil, one of minced
        parsley, a dessert-spoonful of onions chopped very
        fine, with cayenne and salt to taste. Shredded
        anchovies may be added, although it is preferable
        without; and this salad should be made a couple of
        hours or so before partaken of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The German recipe for a potato salad is too
    nasty to quote; and their <span class="smcap">Herring Salad</span>,
    although said to be a valuable restorative of nerve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> power, by no means presents an attractive appearance,
    when served at table. Far more to
    the mind and palate of the average epicure is a</p>
<h4><i>Tomato Salad</i>.</h4>
<p>This is the author&rsquo;s recipe:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Four large tomatoes and one Spanish onion, cut
        into thin slices. Mix a spot of mustard, a little
        white pepper and salt, with vinegar, in a table-spoon,
        pour it over the love apples, etc., and then add two
        tablespoonfuls of oil. Mix well, and then sprinkle
        over the mixture a few drops of Lea and Perrins&rsquo;s
        Worcester Sauce. For the fair sex, the last part of
        the programme may be omitted, but on no account
        leave out the breath of sunny Spain. And mark
        this well. The man, or woman, who mixes tomatoes
        with lettuces, or endives, in the bowl, is hereby
        sentenced to translate the whole of this book into
        Court English.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Celery Salad.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>An excellent winter salad is made with beetroot
        and celery, cut in thin slices, and served&mdash;with or
        without onions&mdash;either with a mayonnaise sauce, or
        with a plain cream sauce: to every tablespoonful of
        cream add a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, a little
        sugar, and a suspicion of cayenne. This salad looks
        best served in alternate slices of beet and celery, on
        a flat silver dish, around the sauce.</p>

<h4><i>A Gentleman Salad Maker.</i></h4>
<p>Although in the metropolis it is still customary,
    in middle-class households, to hire &ldquo;outside
    help&rdquo; on the occasion of a dinner-party, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> not heard for some time of a salad-dresser who
    makes house-to-house visitations in the exercise
    of his profession. But, at the end of the
    18th century, the Chevalier d&rsquo;Allignac, who
    had escaped from Paris to London in the evil
    days of the Revolution, made a fortune in this
    way. He was paid at the rate of £5 a salad, and
    naturally, soon started his own carriage, &ldquo;in
    order that he might pass quickly from house to
    house, during the dining hours of the aristocracy.&rdquo;
    High as the fee may appear to be, it is
    impossible to measure the width of the gulf
    which lies between the salad as made by a lover
    of the art, and the kitchen-wench; and a perfect
    salad is, like a perfect curry, &ldquo;far above rubies.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>A Memorable Salad</i></h4>
<p>was once served in my own mansion. The <i>chef</i>, who understood these matters well, when
    her hair was free from vine leaves, had been
    celebrating her birthday or some other festival;
    and had mixed the dressing with Colza oil. Her
    funeral was largely attended.</p>

<p>It has, I hope, been made sufficiently clear that
    neither water-cress nor radishes should figure in a
    dressed salad; from the which I would also exclude
    such &ldquo;small deer&rdquo; as mustard and cress. There
    is, however, no black mark against the narrow-leaved <span class="smcap">Corn Salad</span> plant, or &ldquo;lamb&rsquo;s lettuce&rdquo;;
    and its great advantage is that it can be grown
    almost anywhere during the winter months, when
    lettuces have to be &ldquo;coddled,&rdquo; and thereby robbed
    of most of their flavour.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Instead of yolk of egg, in a dressing, cheese may
        be used, with good results, either cream cheese&mdash;<i>not</i> the poor stuff made on straws, but what are known as
        &ldquo;napkin,&rdquo; or &ldquo;New Forest&rdquo; cheeses&mdash;or Cheddar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> Squash it well up with oil and vinegar, and do not
        use too much. A piece of cheese the size of an
        average lump of sugar will be ample, and will lend
        a most agreeable flavour to the mixture.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Roman Salad</i></h4>
<p>Lucullus and Co.&mdash;or rather their cooks&mdash;had
    much to learn in the preparation of the
    &ldquo;herbaceous meat&rdquo; which delighted Sydney
    Smith. The Romans cultivated endive; this
    was washed free from &ldquo;matter in the wrong
    place,&rdquo; chopped small&mdash;absolutely fatal to the
    taste&mdash;anointed with oil and <i>liquamen</i>, topped up
    with chopped onions, and further ornamented
    with honey and vinegar. But before finding
    fault with the conquerors of the world for mixing
    honey with a salad, it should be remembered that
    they knew not &ldquo;fine Demerara,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;best lump,&rdquo;
    nor even the beet sugar which can be made at
    home. Still I should not set a Roman salad
    before my creditors, if I wanted them to have
    &ldquo;patience.&rdquo; An offer of the very smallest dividend
    would be preferable.</p>
<h4><i>Italian Salad.</i></h4>
<p>The merry Italian has improved considerably
    upon the herbaceous treat (I rather prefer &ldquo;treat&rdquo;
    to &ldquo;meat&rdquo;) of his ancestors; though he is far
    too fond of mixing flesh-meat of all sorts with his
    dressed herbs, and his boiled vegetables. Two
    cold potatoes and half a medium sized beet sliced,
    mixed with boiled celery and Brussels sprouts,
    form a common salad in the sunny South; the
    dressing being usually oil and vinegar, occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> oil <i>seule</i>, and sometimes a <i>Tartare</i> sauce. Stoned
    olives are usually placed atop of the mess, which
    includes fragments of chicken, or veal and ham.</p>
<h4><i>Russian Salad.</i></h4>
<p>This is a difficult task to build up; for a sort
    of Cleopatra&rsquo;s Needle, or pyramid, of cooked
    vegetables, herbs, pickles, etc., has to be erected
    on a flat dish. Carrots, turnips, green peas,
    asparagus, French beans, beetroot, capers, pickled
    cucumbers, and horse-radish, form the solid
    matter of which the pyramid is built.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Lay a <i>stratum</i> on the dish, and anoint the <i>stratum</i> with <i>Tartare</i> sauce. Each layer must be similarly
        anointed, and must be of less circumference than the
        one underneath, till the top layer consists of one
        caper. Garnish with bombs of caviare, sliced lemon,
        crayfish, olives, and salted cucumber; and then give
        the salad to the policeman on fixed-point duty. At
        least, if you take my advice.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Anchovy Salad.</i></h4>
<p>This is usually eaten at the commencement
    of dinner, as a <i>hors d&rsquo;&#339;uvre</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Some shreds of anchovy should be arranged
        &ldquo;criss-cross&rdquo; in a flat glass dish. Surround it with
        small heaps of chopped truffles, yolk and white of
        hard-boiled eggs, capers, and a stoned olive or two.
        Mix all the ingredients together with a little Chili
        vinegar, and twice the quantity of oil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mixture is said to be invaluable as an
    appetiser; but the modest oyster on the <i>deep
    shell</i>&mdash;if he has not been fattened at the bolt-hole
    of the main sewer&mdash;is to be preferred.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>Cooked vegetables, for salad purposes, are not,
    nor will they ever be, popular in England, Nine
    out of ten Britains will eat the &ldquo;one sauce&rdquo;
    with asparagus, in preference to the oiled butter,
    or plain salad dressing, of mustard, vinegar,
    pepper, salt, and oil; whilst &rsquo;tis almost hopeless
    to attempt to dissuade madame the cook from
    smothering her cauliflowers with liquefied paste,
    before sending them to table. Many a wild weed
    which foreign nations snatch greedily from the
    soil, prior to dressing it, is passed by with scorn
    by our islanders, including the dandelion, which
    is a favourite of our lively neighbours, for salad
    purposes, and is doubtless highly beneficial to the
    human liver. So is the cauliflower; and an
    eminent medical authority once gave out that the
    man who ate a parboiled cauliflower, as a salad,
    every other day, need never send for a doctor.
    Which sounds rather like fouling his own nest.</p>
<h4><i>Fruit Salad.</i></h4>
<p>This is simply a French <i>compôte</i> of cherries,
    green almonds, pears, limes, peaches, apricots in
    syrup slightly flavoured with ginger; and goes
    excellent well with any cold brown game. Try it.</p>
<h4><i>Orange Salad.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Peel your orange, and cut it into thin slices.
        Arrange these in a glass dish, and sugar them well.
        Then pour over them a glass of sherry, a glass of
        brandy, and a glass of maraschino.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Orange Sauce.</i></h4>
<p>Cold mutton, according to my notions, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> &ldquo;absolutely beastly,&rdquo; to the palate. More happy
    homes have been broken up by this simple dish
    than by the entire army of Europe. And &rsquo;tis
    a dish which should never be allowed to wander
    outside the servants&rsquo; hall. The superior domestics
    who take their meals in the steward&rsquo;s room, would
    certainly rise in a body, and protest against the
    indignity of a cold leg, or shoulder. As for a
    cold loin&mdash;but the idea is too awful. Still,
    brightened up by the following condiment, cold
    mutton will go down smoothly, and even gratefully:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Rub off the thin yellow rind of two oranges on
        four lumps of sugar. Put these into a bowl, and
        pour in a wine-glass of port, a quarter pint of dissolved
        red-currant jelly, a teaspoonful of mixed
        mustard&mdash;don&rsquo;t be frightened, it&rsquo;s all right&mdash;a finely-minced
        shallot, a pinch of cayenne, and some more
        thin orange rind. Mix well. When heated up,
        strain and bottle off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But amateur sauces should, on the whole, be
    discouraged. The writer has tasted dozens of
    imitations of Lea and Perrins&rsquo;s &ldquo;inimitable,&rdquo; and
    it is still inimitable, and unapproachable. It is the
    same with chutnee. You can get anything in
    that line you want at Stembridge&rsquo;s, close to
    Leicester Square, to whom the writer is indebted
    for some valuable hints. But here is a recipe
    for a mixture of chutnee and pickle, which must
    have been written a long time ago; for the two
    operations are transposed. For instance, <i>the
    onions should be dealt with first</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Chutnine.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Ten or twelve large apples, peeled and cored, put
        in an earthenware jar, with a little vinegar (on no
        account use water) in the oven. Let them remain
        till in a pulp, then take out, and add half an ounce
        of curry powder, one ounce of ground ginger, half a
        pound of stoned raisins, chopped fine, half a pound
        moist sugar, one teaspoonful cayenne pepper, one
        tablespoonful salt. Take four large onions (<i>this
        should be done first</i>), chop very fine, and put them in
        a jar with a pint and a half of vinegar. Cork tightly
        and let them remain a week. Then add the rest
        of the ingredients, after mixing them well together.
        Cork tightly, and the chutnine will be ready for
        use in a month. It improves, however, by keeping
        for a year or so.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Raw Chutnee</i></h4>
<p>is another aid to the consumption of cold meat,
    and I have also seen it used as an accompaniment
    to curry, but do not recommend the
    mixture.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>One large tomato, one smaller Spanish onion, one
        green chili, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Pulp
        the tomato; don&rsquo;t try to extract the seeds, for life
        is too short for that operation. Chop the onion and
        the chili very fine, and mix the lot up with a pinch
        of salt, and the same quantity of sifted sugar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know plenty of men who would break up
    their homes (after serving the furniture in the
    same way) and emigrate; who would go on
    strike, were roast beef to be served at the dinner-table
    unaccompanied by horse-radish sauce. But
    this is a relish for the national dish which is
    frequently overlooked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Horse-radish Sauce.</i></h4>
<p>Grate a young root as fine as you can. It is
    perhaps needless to add that the fresher the horse-radish
    the better. No vegetables taste as well
    as those grown in your own garden, and gathered,
    or dug up, just before wanted. And the horse-radish,
    like the Jerusalem artichoke, comes to
    stay. When once he gets a footing in your
    garden you will never dislodge him; nor will
    you want to. Very well, then:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Having grated your horse, add a quarter of a pint
        of cream&mdash;English or Devonshire&mdash;a dessert-spoonful
        of sifted sugar, half that quantity of salt, and a tablespoonful
        of vinegar. Mix all together, and, if for
        hot meat, heat in the oven, taking care that the
        mixture does not curdle. Many people use oil
        instead of cream, and mix grated orange rind with
        the sauce. The Germans do not use oil, but either
        make the relish with cream, or hard-boiled yolk of
        egg. Horse-radish sauce for hot meat may also be
        heated by pouring it into a jar, and standing the
        jar in boiling water&mdash;&ldquo;jugging it&rdquo; in fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Celery Sauce</i>,</h4>
<p>for boiled pheasant, or turkey, is made thus:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Two or three heads of celery, sliced thin, put
        into a saucepan with equal quantities of sugar and
        salt, a dust of white pepper, and two or three ounces
        of butter. Stew your celery slowly till it becomes
        pulpy, but <i>not brown</i>, add two or three ounces of flour,
        and a good half-pint of milk, or cream. Let it
        simmer twenty minutes, and then rub the mixture
        through a sieve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>The carp as an item of food is, according to
    my ideas, a fraud. He tastes principally of the
    mud in which he has been wallowing until
    dragged out by the angler. The ancients loved
    a dish of carp, and yet they knew not the only
    sauce to make him at all palatable.</p>
<h4><i>Sauce for Carp.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>One ounce of butter, a quarter pint of good beef
        gravy, one dessert-spoonful of flour, a quarter pint
        of cream and two anchovies chopped very small.
        Mix over the fire, stir well till boiling, then take off,
        add a little Worcester sauce, and a squeeze of lemon,
        just before serving.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Christopher North&rsquo;s Sauce.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>This is a very old recipe. Put a dessert-spoonful
        of sifted sugar, a salt-spoonful of salt, and rather
        more than that quantity of cayenne, into a jar. Mix
        thoroughly, and add, gradually, two tablespoonfuls of
        Harvey&rsquo;s sauce, a dessert-spoonful of mushroom
        ketchup, a tablespoonful of lemon juice, and a large
        glass of port. Place the jar in a saucepan of boiling
        water, and let it remain till the mixture is very hot,
        but not boiling. If bottled directly after made, the
        sauce will keep for a week, and may be used for
        duck, goose, pork, or (Christopher adds) &ldquo;any broil.&rdquo;
        But there is but <i>one</i> broil sauce, the <span class="smcap">Gubbins Sauce</span>,
        already mentioned in this work.</p>

<h4><i>Sauce for Hare.</i></h4>
<p>What a piece of work is a hare! And what
    a piece of work it is to cook him in a laudable
    fashion!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Crumble some bread&mdash;a handful or so&mdash;soak it
        in port wine, heat over the fire with a small lump
        of butter, a tablespoonful of red-currant jelly, a
        little salt, and a tablespoonful of Chili vinegar.

<p>Mackerel is a fish but seldom seen at the tables
    of the great. And yet &rsquo;tis tasty eating, if his
    Joseph&rsquo;s coat be bright and shining when you
    purchase him. When stale he is dangerous to
    life itself. And he prefers to gratify the human
    palate when accompanied by</p>
<h4><i>Gooseberry Sauce</i>,</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>which is made by simply boiling a few green gooseberries,
        rubbing them through a sieve, and adding a
        little butter and a suspicion of ginger. Then heat
        up. &ldquo;A wine-glassful of sorrel or spinach-juice,&rdquo;
        observes one authority, &ldquo;is a decided improvement.&rdquo;
        H&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;ve tried both, and prefer the gooseberries
        unadorned with spinach liquor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now for a sauce which is deservedly popular
    all over the world, and which is equally at home
    as a salad dressing, as a covering for a steak off a
    fresh-run salmon, or a portion of fried eel; the
    luscious, the invigorating</p>
<h4><i>Sauce Tartare</i>,</h4>
<p>so called because no tallow-eating Tartar was
    ever known to taste thereof. I have already
    given a pretty good recipe for its manufacture,
    in previous salad-dressing instructions, where the
    yolks of hard-boiled eggs are used. But chopped
    chervil, shallots, and (occasionally) gherkins, are
    added to the <i>Tartare</i> arrangement; and frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> the surface is adorned with capers, stoned olives,
    and shredded anchovies.</p>

    has been made of the sucking pig, beloved of

    <p>Boil an ounce of currants, after washing them
        and picking out the tacks, dead flies, etc., in half a
        pint of water, for a few minutes, and pour over
        them a cupful of finely grated crumbs. Let them
        soak well, then beat up with a fork, and stir in about
        a gill of oiled butter. Add two tablespoonfuls of the
        brown gravy made for the pig, a glass of port, and a
        pinch of salt. Stir the sauce well over the fire. It
        is also occasionally served with roast venison; but
        not in the mansions of my friends.</p>

<p>What is sauce for Madame Goose is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> be sauce for Old Man Gander. Never mind
    about that, however. The parents of young
    Master Goose, with whom alone I am going to
    deal, have, like the flowers which bloom in the
    spring, absolutely nothing to do with the case.
    This is the best</p>
<h4><i>Sauce for the Goose</i></h4>
<p>known to civilisation:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Put two ounces of green sage leaves into a jar with
        an ounce of the thin yellow rind of a lemon, a
        minced shallot, a teaspoonful of salt, half a ditto of
        cayenne, and a pint of claret. Let this soak for a
        fortnight, then pour off the liquid into a tureen;
        or boil with some good gravy. This sauce will keep
        for a week or two, bottled and well corked up.</p>

<p>And now, having given directions for the
    manufacture of sundry &ldquo;cloyless sauces&rdquo;&mdash;with
    only one of the number having any connection
    with <i>Ala</i>, and that one a sauce of world-wide
    reputation, I will conclude this chapter with a
    little fancy work. It is not probable that many
    who do me the honour to skim through these
    humble, faultily-written, but heartfelt gastronomic
    hints are personally acquainted with the cloyless</p>
<h4><i>Sambal</i>,</h4>
<p>who is a lady of dusky origin. But let us quit
    metaphor, and direct the gardener to</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Cut the finest and straightest cucumber in his
        crystal palace. Cut both ends off, and divide the
        remainder into two-inch lengths. Peel these, and
        let them repose in salt to draw out the water, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> is the indigestible part of the cucumber. Then
        take each length, in succession, and with a very
        sharp knife&mdash;a penknife is best for the purpose&mdash;pare
        it from surface to centre, until it has become
        one long, curly shred. Curl it up tight, so that it
        may resemble in form the spring of a Waterbury
        watch. Cut the length through from end to end,
        until you have made numerous long thin shreds.
        Treat each length in the same way, and place in a
        glass dish. Add three green chilies, chopped fine,
        a few chopped spring onions, and some tiny shreds
        of the Blue Fish of Java. Having performed a fishless
        pilgrimage in search of this curiosity, you will
        naturally fall back upon the common or Italian
        anchovy, which, after extracting the brine and bones,
        and cleansing, chop fine. Pour a little vinegar over
        the mixture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sambal&rdquo; will be found a delicious accompaniment
    to curry&mdash;when served on a salad plate&mdash;or
    to almost any description of cold meat and
    cheese. It is only fair to add, however, that the
    task of making the relish is arduous and exasperating
    to a degree; and that the woman who
    makes it&mdash;no male Christian in the world is
    possessed of a tithe of the necessary patience,
    now that Job and Robert Bruce are no more&mdash;should
    have the apartment to herself. For the
    labour is calculated to teach an entirely new
    language to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>That cruel and catlike courtesan, Cleopatra, is
    alleged to have given the most expensive supper
    on record, and to have disposed of the <i>bonne bouche</i> herself, in the shape of a pearl, valued at the
    equivalent of £250,000, dissolved in vinegar of
    extra strength. Such a sum is rather more than
    is paid for a supper at the Savoy, or the Cecil,
    or the Metropole, in these more practical times,
    when pearls are to be had cheaper; and there is
    probably about as much truth in this pearl story
    as in a great many others of the same period. I
    have heard of a fair <i>declassée</i> leader of fashion at
    Monte Carlo, who commanded that her <i>major
    domo</i> should be put to death for not having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> telegraphed to Paris for peaches, for a special
    dinner; but the woman who could melt a pearl
    in vinegar, and then drink&mdash;&mdash;<i>halte la!</i> Perhaps
    the pearl was displayed in the deep shell of the
    oyster of which the &ldquo;noble curtesan&rdquo; partook?
    We know how Mark Antony&rsquo;s countrymen valued
    the succulent bivalve; and probably an oyster
    feast at Wady Halfa or Dongola was a common
    function long before London knew a &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
    a &ldquo;Pimm&rsquo;s,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Sweeting&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks partly to the &ldquo;typhoid scare,&rdquo; but
    principally to the prohibitive price, the &ldquo;native&rdquo;
    industry of Britain has been, at the latter end
    of the nineteenth century, by no means active,
    although in the illustrated annuals Uncle John
    still brings with him a barrel of the luscious
    bivalves, in addition to assorted toys for the
    children, when he arrives in the midst of a
    snow-storm at the old hall on Christmas Eve.
    But Uncle John, that good fairy of our youth,
    when Charles Dickens invented the &ldquo;festive
    season,&rdquo; and the very atmosphere reeked of
    goose-stuffing, resides, for the most part, &ldquo;in
    Sheffield,&rdquo; in these practical days, when sentiment
    and goodwill to relatives are rapidly giving place
    to matters of fact, motor cars, and mammoth
    rates.</p>
<p>The Asiatic oyster is not altogether commendable,
    his chief merit consisting in his size. Once
    whilst paying a flying visit to the city of Kurachi,
    I ordered a dozen oysters at the principal hotel.
    Then I went out to inspect the lions. On my
    return I could hardly push my way into the
    coffee-room. It was full of oyster! There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> no room for anything else. In fact <i>one</i> Kurachi
    oyster is a meal for four full-grown men.</p>
<p>More tragic still was my experience of the
    bivalves procurable at Aden&mdash;which cinder-heap
    I have always considered to be a foretaste of even
    hotter things below. Instead of living on coal-dust
    (as might naturally be expected) the Aden
    oyster appears to do himself particularly well on
    some preparation of copper. The only time I
    tasted him, the after consequences very nearly
    prevented my ever tasting anything else, on
    this sphere. And it was only the comfort
    administered by the steward of my cabin which
    got me round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said that functionary, as he looked in
    to see whether I would take hot pickled pork
    or roast goose for dinner. &ldquo;The last time we
    touched at Aden, there was two gents &rsquo;ad &rsquo;ysters.
    One of &rsquo;em died the same night, and the other
    nex&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed so much that the poison left my
    system.</p>
<p>Yet still we eat oysters&mdash;the <i>Sans Bacilles</i> brand, for choice. And if we can only persuade
    the young gentleman who opens the bivalves to
    refrain from washing the grit off each in the tub
    of dirty water behind the bar, so much the better.
    And above all, the bivalves should be opened on
    the <i>deep</i> shell, so as to conserve some of the juice;
    for it is advisable to get as much of the bivalve
    as we can for the money. Every time I crunch
    the bones of a lark I feel that I am devouring an
    oratorio, in the way of song; and whilst the
    bivalve is sliding down the &ldquo;red lane&rdquo; it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> be as well to reflect that &ldquo;there slips away
    fourpence&rdquo;; or, as the Scotsman had it, &ldquo;bang
    went saxpence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with Mr. Bob Sawyer&rsquo;s supper
    party in <i>Pickwick</i>, it may be recollected that &ldquo;the
    man to whom the order for the oysters had been
    sent had not been told to open them; it is a very
    difficult thing to open an oyster with a limp knife
    or a two-pronged fork: and very little was done
    in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in one&rsquo;s own house, unless there be an
    adept at oyster-opening present, the simplest way
    to treat the bivalve is the following. It should
    be remembered that a badly-opened oyster will
    resemble in flavour a slug on a gravel walk.
    So <i>roast</i> him, good friends, in his own fortress.</p>
<h4><i>Oysters in their own Juice.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>With the tongs place half-a-dozen oysters, mouths
        outwards, between the red-hot coals of the parlour
        or dining-room fire&mdash;the deep shell must be at the
        bottom&mdash;and the oysters will be cooked in a few
        minutes, or when the shells gape wide. Pull them
        out with the tongs, and insert a fresh batch. No
        pepper, vinegar, or lemon juice is necessary as an
        adjunct; and the oyster never tastes better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At most eating-houses,</p>
<h4><i>Scalloped Oysters</i></h4>
<p>taste of nothing but scorched bread-crumbs; and
    the reason is obvious, for there is but little else
    in the scallop shell. <i>Natives only</i> should be used.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Open and beard two dozen, and cut each bivalve
        in half. Melt two ounces of butter in a stewpan,
        and mix into it the same allowance of flour, the
        strained oyster liquor, a teacupful of cream, half a
        teaspoonful of essence of anchovies, and a pinch of
        cayenne&mdash;death to the caitiff who adds nutmeg&mdash;and
        stir the sauce well over the fire. Take it off,
        and add the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, a tablespoonful
        of finely chopped parsley, and a teaspoonful
        of lemon juice. Put in the oysters, and stir the
        whole over a gentle fire for five minutes. Put the
        mixture in the shells, grate bread-crumbs over, place a
        small piece of butter atop, and bake in a Dutch oven
        before a clear fire until the crumbs are lightly browned,
        which should be in about a quarter of an hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Oyster Stew</i></h4>
<p>is thoroughly understood in New York City.
    On this side, the dish does not meet with any
    particular favour, although no supper-table is
    properly furnished without it.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Open two dozen oysters, and take the beards off.
        Put the oysters into a basin and squeeze over them
        the juice of half a lemon. Put the beards and the
        strained liquor into a saucepan with half a blade of
        mace, half a dozen peppercorns ground, a little grated
        lemon rind, and a pinch of cayenne. Simmer gently
        for a quarter of an hour, strain the liquid, thicken it
        with a little butter and flour, add a quarter of a pint
        (or a teacupful) of cream, and stir over the fire till
        quite smooth. Then put in the oysters, and let
        them warm through&mdash;they must not boil. Serve in
        a soup tureen, and little cubes of bread fried in bacon
        grease may be served with the stew, as with pea-soup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be very careful to whose care you entrust
    your barrel, or bag, of oysters, after you have got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> them home. A consignment of the writer&rsquo;s
    were, on one memorable and bitter cold Christmas
    Eve, consigned to the back dairy, by Matilda
    Anne. Result&mdash;frostbite, gapes, dissolution,
    disappointment, disagreeable language.</p>
<h4><i>Ball Suppers.</i></h4>
<p>More hard cash is wasted on these than even
    on ball dresses, which is saying a great deal. The
    alien caterer, or <i>charcutier</i>, is chiefly to blame
    for this; for he it is who has taught the British
    matron to wrap up wholesome food in coats of
    grease, inlaid with foreign substances, to destroy
    its flavour, and to bestow upon it an outward
    semblance other than its own. There was
    handed unto me, only the other evening, what I
    at first imagined to be a small section of the
    celebrated <i>Taj Mahal</i> at Agra, the magnificent
    mausoleum of the Emperor Shah Jehan. Reference
    to the bill-of-fare established the fact that I
    was merely sampling a galantine of turkey,
    smothered in some white glazy grease, inlaid
    with chopped carrot, green peas, truffles, and
    other things. And the marble column (also
    inlaid) which might have belonged to King
    Solomon&rsquo;s Temple, at the top of the table, turned
    out to be a Tay salmon, decorated <i>à la mode de
    charcutier</i>, and tasting principally of garlic. A
    shriek from a fair neighbour caused me to turn
    my head in her direction; and it took some
    little time to discover, and to convince her, that
    the item on her plate was not a mouse, too
    frightened to move, but some preparation of the
    liver of a goose, in &ldquo;aspic.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>This said <span class="smcap">Aspic</span>&mdash;which has no connection
    with the asp which the fair Cleopatra kept on
    the premises, although a great French lexicographer
    says that aspic is so called because it is
    as cold as a snake&mdash;is invaluable in the numerous
    &ldquo;schools of cookery&rdquo; in the which British
    females are educated according to the teaching
    of the bad fairy <i>Ala</i>. The cold chicken and
    ham which delighted our ancestors at the supper-table&mdash;what
    has become of them? Yonder, my
    dear sir, is the fowl, in neat portions, minced,
    and made to represent fragments of the almond
    rock which delighted us whilst in the nursery.
    The ham has become a ridiculous <i>mousse</i>, placed
    in little accordion-pleated receptacles of snow-white
    paper; and those are not poached eggs
    atop, either, but dabs of whipped cream with a
    preserved apricot in the centre.</p>
<p>It was only the other day that I read in a
    journal written by ladies for ladies, of a dainty
    dish for luncheon or supper: <i>croûtons</i> smeared
    with bloater paste and surmounted with whipped
    cream; and in the same paper was a recipe for
    stuffing a fresh herring with mushrooms, parsley,
    yolk of egg, onion, and its own soft roe. I am
    of opinion that it was a bad day for the male
    Briton when the gudewife, with her gude-daughter,
    and her gude cook, abandoned the
    gude roast and boiled, in favour of the works of
    the all-powerful <i>Ala</i>.</p>
<p>And now let us proceed to discuss the most
    homely supper of all, and when I mention the
    magic word</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Tripe</i></h4>
<p>there be few of my readers who will not at once
    allow that it is not only the most homely of
    food, but forms an ideal supper. This doctrine
    had not got in its work, however, in the &rsquo;sixties,
    at about which period the man who avowed
    himself an habitual tripe-eater must have been
    possessed of a considerable amount of nerve.
    Some of the supper-houses served it&mdash;such as
    the Albion, the Coal Hole, and more particularly,
    &ldquo;Noakes&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the familiar name for the old
    Opera Tavern which used to face the Royal
    Italian Opera House, in Bow Street, Covent
    Garden. But the more genteel food-emporiums
    fought shy of tripe until within three decades of the
    close of the nineteenth century. Then it began
    to figure on the supper bills, in out-of-the-way
    corners; until supper-eaters in general discovered
    that this was not only an exceedingly cheap, but
    a very nourishing article of food, which did not
    require any special divine aid to digest. Then
    the price of tripe went up 75 per cent on the
    programmes. Then the most popular burlesque <i>artiste</i> of any age put the stamp of approval upon
    the new supper-dish, and tripe-dressing became
    as lucrative a profession as gold-crushing.</p>
<p>There is a legend afloat of an eminent actor&mdash;poor
    &ldquo;Ned&rdquo; Sothern, I fancy, as &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo;
    Toole would never have done such a thing&mdash;who
    bade some of his friends and acquaintance
    to supper, and regaled them on sundry rolls
    of house flannel, smothered with the orthodox
    onion sauce. But that is another story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> Practical jokes should find no place in this
    volume, which is written to benefit, and not
    alarm, posterity. Therefore let us discuss the
    problem</p>
<h4><i>How to Cook Tripe</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Ask for &ldquo;double-tripe,&rdquo; and see that the dresser
        gives it you nice and white. Wash it, cut into
        portions, and place in equal parts of milk and water,
        boiling fast. Remove the saucepan from the hottest
        part of the fire, and let the tripe keep just on the
        boil for an hour and a half. Serve with whole
        onions and onion sauce&mdash;in this work you will not
        be told how to manufacture onion sauce&mdash;and
        baked potatoes should always accompany this dish to
        table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people like their tripe cut into strips
    rolled up and tied with cotton, before being
    placed in the saucepan; but there is really no
    necessity to take this further trouble. And if
    the cook should forget to remove the cotton before
    serving, you might get your tongues tied in
    knots. In the North Riding of Yorkshire,
    some of the farmers&rsquo; wives egg-and-bread-crumb
    fillets of tripe, and fry them in the drip
    of thick rashers of ham which have been fried
    previously. The ham is served in the centre
    of the dish, with the fillets around the pig-pieces.
    This is said to be an excellent dish, but I
    prefer my tripe smothered in onions, like the
    timid &ldquo;bunny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edmund Yates, in his &ldquo;Reminiscences,&rdquo; describes
    &ldquo;nice, cosy, little suppers,&rdquo; of which in his
    early youth he used to partake, at the house of his
    maternal grandfather, in Kentish Town. &ldquo;He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> dined at two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; observed the late proprietor
    of the <i>World</i>, &ldquo;and had the most delightful
    suppers at nine; suppers of sprats, or
    kidneys, or tripe and onions; with foaming
    porter and hot grog afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot share the enthusiasm possessed by
    some people for <span class="smcap">Sprats</span>, as an article of diet.
    When very &ldquo;full-blown,&rdquo; the little fish make
    an excellent fertiliser for Marshal Niel roses;
    but as &ldquo;winter whitebait,&rdquo; or sardines they are
    hardly up to &ldquo;Derby form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sprats are not much encouraged at the
    fashionable hotels; and when tripe is brought
    to table, which is but rarely, that food is nearly
    always filleted, sprinkled with chopped parsley,
    and served with tomato sauce.</p>
<p>This is the sort of supper which is provided in
    the &ldquo;gilt-edged&rdquo; <i>caravanserais</i> of the metropolis,
    the following being a <i>verbatim</i> copy of a bill of
    fare at the Hotel Cecil:&mdash;</p>

<p>A lady-like repast this; and upon the whole,
    not dear. But roast loin of mutton hardly
    sounds tasty enough for a meal partaken of
    somewhere about the stroke of midnight. Still,
    such a supper is by no means calculated to
    &ldquo;murder sleep.&rdquo; Upon the other hand it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> little difficult to credit the fact that the whole of
    the party invited by &ldquo;My Lord Tomnoddy&rdquo; to
    refresh themselves at the &ldquo;Magpie and Stump,&rdquo;
    including the noble host himself, should have
    slumbered peacefully, with a noisy crowd in the
    street, after a supper which consisted of</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Early Closing Act of 1872 had a disastrous
    effect upon the old London supper-houses.
    What Mr. John Hollingshead never tired of
    calling the &ldquo;slap-me-and-put-me-to-bed law&rdquo;
    rang the knell of many a licensed tavern, well-conducted,
    where plain, well-cooked food and
    sound liquor were to be obtained by men who
    would have astonished their respective couches
    had they sought them before the small hours.</p>
<h4><i>Evans&rsquo;s.</i></h4>
<p>The &ldquo;Cave of Harmony&rdquo; of Thackeray was
    a different place to the &ldquo;Evans&rsquo;s&rdquo; of my youthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> days. Like the younger Newcome, I was
    taken there in the first instance, by the author
    of my being. But Captain Costigan was conspicuous
    by his absence; and &ldquo;Sam Hall&rdquo; was <i>non est</i>. I noted well the abnormal size of the
    broiled kidneys, and in my ignorance of anatomy,
    imagined that Evans&rsquo;s sheep must be subjected
    to somewhat the same process&mdash;the &ldquo;ordeal by
    fire&rdquo;&mdash;as the Strasbourg geese. And the
    potatoes&mdash;zounds, sirs! What potatoes! &ldquo;Shall I
    turn it out, sir?&rdquo; inquired the attentive waiter;
    and, as he seized the tuber, enveloped in the snow-white
    napkin, broke it in two, and ejected a
    floury pyramid upon my plate, I would, had I
    known of such a decoration in those days, have
    gladly recommended that attendant for the Distinguished
    Service order. In the course of many
    visits I never saw any supper commodity served
    here besides chops, steaks, kidneys, welsh-rarebits,
    poached eggs, and (I think) sausages; and the
    earliest impression made upon a youthful memory
    was the air of extreme confidence which pervaded
    the place. We certainly &ldquo;remembered&rdquo; the
    waiter; but not even a potato was paid for until
    we encountered the head functionary at the exit
    door; and his peculiar ideas of arithmetic would
    have given Bishop Colenso a succession of fits.</p>
<p>Who &ldquo;Evans&rdquo; was, we neither knew nor
    cared. &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; Green, with his chronic
    smile, was enough for us; as he proffered his
    ever-ready snuff-box, inquired after our relatives&mdash;&ldquo;Paddy,&rdquo;
    like &ldquo;Spanky&rdquo; at Eton, knew everybody&mdash;and
    implored silence whilst the quintette <i>Integer Vitæ</i> was being sung by the choir. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> used to venerate that quintette far more than any
    music we ever heard in church, and I am certain
    &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; Green would have backed his little
    pack of choristers&mdash;who, according to the general
    belief, passed the hours of daylight in waking the
    echoes of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, or Westminster
    Abbey, and therefore, at Evans&rsquo;s, always looked
    a bit stale and sleepy&mdash;against any choir in the
    world. As for Harry Sidney, the fat, jolly-looking
    gentleman who was wont to string together the
    topics of the day and reproduce them, fresh as
    rolls, set to music, we could never hear enough
    of him; and I wish I had now some of the half-crowns
    which in the past were bestowed upon
    Herr Von Joel, the indifferent <i>siffleur</i>, who was
    &ldquo;permanently retained upon the premises,&rdquo; and
    who was always going to take a benefit the
    following week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidneys and &rsquo;armony&rdquo;&mdash;that was the old
    programme in the &ldquo;Cave.&rdquo; And then the march
    of time killed poor old Paddy, and another
    management reigned. Gradually the &ldquo;lady
    element&rdquo; was introduced, and a portion of the hall
    was set apart for the mixed assembly. And then
    came trouble, and, finally, disestablishment. And
    for some time before the closing of the Cave as
    a place of entertainment, it was customary to
    remove the fine old pictures (what became of
    them, I wonder), from the walls, at &ldquo;Varsity
    Boat Race&rdquo; time. For the undergraduate of those
    days was nothing if not rowdy. Youth will have
    its fling; and at Evans&rsquo;s the fling took the form
    of tumblers. Well do I recollect a fight in &ldquo;the
    old style&rdquo; in the very part of the &ldquo;Cave&rdquo; where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> eminent barristers, actors, and other wits of a
    past age, used to congregate. The premier boxer
    of Cambridge University had been exercising his
    undoubted talents as a breaker of glass, during
    the evening, and at length the overwrought
    manager obliged him with an opponent worthy of
    his fists in the person of a waiter who could also
    put up his fists. Several rounds were fought,
    strictly according to the rules of the Prize Ring,
    and in the result, whilst the waiter had sustained
    considerable damage to his ribs, the &ldquo;Cambridge
    gent&rdquo; had two very fine black eyes. Well do I
    remember that &ldquo;mill,&rdquo; also the waiter, who
    afterwards became an habitual follower of the
    turf.</p>
<p>If Cremorne introduced the fashion of &ldquo;long
    drinks,&rdquo; sodas, and et ceteras, the suppers served
    in the old gardens had not much to recommend
    them. A slice or two of cold beef, or a leg
    of a chicken, with some particularly salt ham,
    formed the average fare; but those who possessed
    their souls with patience occasionally saw something
    hot, in the way of food&mdash;chiefly cutlets.
    The great virtue of the cutlet is that it can be
    reheated; and one dish not infrequently did
    duty for more than one party. The rejected
    portion, in fact, would &ldquo;reappear&rdquo; as often as a
    retiring actor. &ldquo;I know them salmon cutlets,&rdquo;
    the waiter in <i>Pink Dominoes</i> used to observe, &ldquo;as
    well as I know my own mother!&rdquo; In fact,
    Cremorne, like the &ldquo;night houses&rdquo; of old, was
    not an ideal place to sup at.</p>
<p>But, <i>per contra</i>, the &ldquo;Albion&rdquo; <i>was</i>. Until
    the enforcement of the &ldquo;slap-me-and-put-me-to-bed&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> policy there was no more justly celebrated
    house of entertainment than the one which
    almost faced the stage door of Drury Lane
    theatre, in Great Russell Street. One of the
    brothers Cooper&mdash;another kept the Rainbow in
    Fleet Street&mdash;retired on a fortune made here,
    simply by pursuing the policy of giving his
    customers the best of everything. And a rare,
    Bohemian stamp of customers he had, too&mdash;a
    nice, large-hearted, open-handed lot of actors,
    successful and otherwise, dramatic critics ditto,
    and ditto journalists, also variegated in degree;
    with the usual, necessary, leavening of the
    &ldquo;City&rdquo; element. The custom of the fair sex
    was not encouraged at the old tavern; though
    in a room on the first floor they were permitted
    to sup, if in &ldquo;the profession&rdquo; and accompanied
    by males, whose manners and customs
    could be vouched for. In winter time, assorted
    grills, of fish, flesh, and fowl, were served as
    supper dishes; whilst tripe was the staple food.
    Welsh rarebits, too, were in immense demand.
    And I think it was here that I devoured, with
    no fear of the future before my plate, a</p>
<h4><i>Buck Rarebit</i>.</h4>
<p>During the silent watches of the rest of the
    morning, bile and dyspepsia fought heroically for
    my soul; and yet the little animal is easy enough
    to prepare, being nothing grander than a Welsh
    rarebit, with a poached egg atop. But the little
    tins (silver, like the forks and spoons, until the
    greed and forgetfulness of mankind necessitated
    the substitution of electro-plate) which the Hebes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> at the &ldquo;Old Cheshire Cheese&rdquo; fill with fragments
    of the hostelry&rsquo;s godfather&mdash;subsequently to be
    stewed in good old ale&mdash;are less harmful to the
    interior of the human diaphragm.</p>
<p>A favourite Albion supper-dish during the
    summer months was</p>
<h4><i>Lamb&rsquo;s Head and Mince</i>.</h4>
<p>I have preserved the recipe, a gift from one
    of the waiters&mdash;but whether Ponsford, Taylor,
    or &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; (so-called because he bore not
    the faintest resemblance to the immortal bard) I
    forget&mdash;and here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The head should be scalded, scraped, and well
        washed. Don&rsquo;t have it singed, in the Scottish
        fashion, as lamb&rsquo;s wool is not nice to eat. Then
        put it, with the liver (the sweetbread was chopped up
        with the brain, I fancy), into a stewpan, with a
        Spanish onion stuck with cloves, a bunch of parsley,
        a little thyme, a carrot, a turnip, a bay leaf, some
        crushed peppercorns, a tablespoonful of salt, and
        half a gallon of cold water. Let it boil up, skim,
        and then simmer for an hour. Divide the head,
        take out the tongue and brain, and dry the rest of
        the head in a cloth. Mince the liver and tongue,
        season with salt and pepper, and simmer in the
        original gravy (thickened) for half-an-hour. Brush
        the two head-halves with yolk of egg, grate bread
        crumbs over, and bake in oven. The brain and
        sweetbread to be chopped and made into cakes, fried,
        and then placed in the dish around the head-halves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah me! The old tavern, after falling into
    bad ways, entertaining &ldquo;extra-ladies&rdquo; and
    ruined gamesters, has been closed for years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> The ground floor was a potato warehouse the
    last time I passed the place. And it should be
    mentioned that the actors, journalists, etc., who,
    in the &rsquo;seventies, possessed smaller means, or more
    modest ambitions, were in the habit of supping&mdash;on
    supping days&mdash;at a cheaper haunt in the
    Strand, off (alleged) roast goose. But, according
    to one Joseph Eldred, a comedian of some note
    and shirt-cuff, the meat which was apportioned
    to us here was, in reality, always bullock&rsquo;s heart,
    sliced, and with a liberal allowance of sage and
    onions. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the seasoning as does it,&rdquo; observed
    Mr. Samuel Weller.</p>
<p>Then there was another Bohemian house of
    call, and supper place, in those nights&mdash;the
    &ldquo;Occidental,&rdquo; once known as the &ldquo;Coal Hole,&rdquo;
    where, around a large, beautifully polished mahogany
    table, many of the wits of the town&mdash;&ldquo;Harry&rdquo;
    Leigh and &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; Purnell were two
    of the inveterates&mdash;sat, and devoured Welsh
    rarebits, and other things. The house, too,
    could accommodate not a few lodgers; and one
    of its great charms was that nobody cared a
    button what time you retired to your couch, or
    what time you ordered breakfast. In these
    matters, the Occidental resembled the &ldquo;Limmer&rsquo;s&rdquo;
    of the &ldquo;Billy Duff&rdquo; era, and the
    &ldquo;Lane&rsquo;s&rdquo; of my own dear subaltern days.</p>
<h4><i>Parlour Cookery.</i></h4>
<p>It was after the last-named days that, whilst
    on tour with various dramatic combinations&mdash;more
    from necessity than art, as far as I was
    concerned&mdash;that the first principles of parlour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> cookery became impregnated in mine understanding.
    We were not all &ldquo;stars,&rdquo; although
    we did our best. Salaries were (according to
    the advertisements) &ldquo;low but sure&rdquo;; and (according
    to experiences) by no means as sure as
    death, or taxes. The &ldquo;spectre&rdquo; did not invariably
    assume his &ldquo;martial stalk,&rdquo; of a Saturday;
    and cheap provincial lodgings do not hold out
    any extra inducement in the way of cookery.
    So, whilst we endured the efforts of the good
    landlady at the early dinner, some of us determined
    to dish up our own suppers. For the true
    artist never really feels (or never used to feel, at
    all events) like &ldquo;picking a bit&rdquo; until merely
    commercial folks have gone to bed.</p>
<p>Many a time and oft, with the aid of a cigar
    box (empty, of course), a couple of books, and
    an arrangement of plates, have I prepared a
    savoury supper of mushrooms, toasted cheese,
    or a <i>kebob</i> of larks, or other small fowl, in front
    of the fire. More than once have I received
    notice to quit the next morning for grilling
    kidneys on the perforated portion of a handsome
    and costly steel fire-shovel. And by the time I had
    become sufficiently advanced in culinary science
    to stew tripe and onions, in an enamel-lined
    saucepan, the property of the &ldquo;responsible gent,&rdquo;
    we began to give ourselves airs. Landladies&rsquo;
    ideas on the subject of supper for &ldquo;theatricals,&rdquo;
    it may be mentioned, seldom soared above yeast
    dumplings. And few of us liked the name,
    even, of yeast dumplings.</p>
<p>But perhaps the champion effort of all was
    when I was sojourning in the good city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> Carlisle&mdash;known to its inhabitants by the pet
    name of &ldquo;Cannie Carle.&rdquo; A good lady was, for
    her sins, providing us with board and lodging, in
    return for (promised) cash. My then companion
    was a merry youth who afterwards achieved fame
    by writing the very funniest and one of the most
    successful of three-act farces that was ever placed
    upon the stage. Now there is not much the
    matter with a good joint of ribs of beef, roasted to
    a turn. But when that beef is placed on the table
    hot for the Sunday dinner, and cold at every
    succeeding meal until finished up, one&rsquo;s appetite
    for the flesh of the ox begins to slacken. So we
    determined on the Wednesday night to &ldquo;strike&rdquo;
    for a tripe supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; protested the good landlady, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll
    get nae tripe in this hoose, cannie men. Hae ye
    no&rsquo; got guid beef, the noo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late that night we had grilled bones for
    supper; not the ordinary</p>
<h4><i>Grilled Bones</i></h4>
<p>which you get in an eating house, but a vastly
    superior article. We, or rather my messmate, cut
    a rib from off the aforementioned beef, scored the
    flesh across, and placed the bone in the centre of a
    beautifully clear fire which had been specially
    prepared. It was placed there by means of the
    tongs&mdash;a weapon of inestimable value in Parlour
    Cookery&mdash;and withdrawn by the same medium.
    Some of the black wanted scraping off the surface
    of the meat, but the grill was a perfect dream.
    The <span class="smcap">Gubbins Sauce</span>, already mentioned in this
    volume, had not at that time been invented; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> as I was never without a bottle of <span class="smcap">Tapp Sauce</span>&mdash;invaluable
    for Parlour Cookery; you can get it at
    Stembridge&rsquo;s&mdash;we had plenty of relish. Then
    we severed another rib from the carcase, and
    served it in the same manner. For it was winter
    time and we had wearied of frigid ox.</p>
<p>Next morning the landlady&rsquo;s face was a study. I
    rather think that after some conversation, we propitiated
    her with an order for two for the dress circle;
    but it is certain that we had tripe that evening.</p>
<p>An ideal supper in <i>miladi&rsquo;s boudoir</i> is associated,
    in the writer&rsquo;s mind, with rose-coloured draperies,
    dainty china, a cosy fire, a liberal display of <i>lingerie</i>, a strong perfume of heliotrope and orris
    root&mdash;and <i>miladi</i> herself. When next she invites
    her friends, she will kindly order the following
    repast to be spread:&mdash;</p>
<p class="center">Clear soup, in cups.<br />
    Fillets of soles Parisienne.<br />
    Chaudfroid of Quails.<br />
    Barded sweetbreads.<br />
    Perigord pâté.<br />
</p>
<p>By way of contrast, let me quote a typical
    supper-dish which the &ldquo;poor player&rdquo; used to
    order, when he could afford it.</p>
<h4><i>Kidney Dumpling.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Cut a large Spanish onion in half. Take out the
        heart, and substitute a sheep&rsquo;s kidney, cut into four.
        Season with salt and pepper, join the two halves,
        and enclose in a paste. Bake on a buttered tin, in
        a moderate oven, for about an hour.</p>
    <p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Be sure the cook <i>bakes</i> this dumpling, as it
        is not nice boiled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>An artistic friend who at one time of his life
    resided near the great horse-training centre of
    Middleham, in Yorkshire, gave a steak supper at
    the principal inn, to some of the stable attendants.
    The fare was highly approved of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best Scotch beef I ever put tooth into!&rdquo;
    observed the &ldquo;head lad&rdquo; at old Tom Lawson&rsquo;s
    stables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned the host, who was a bit of
    a wag, &ldquo;your beef was cut from a colt of Lord
    Glasgow&rsquo;s that was thought highly of at one time;
    and he was shot the day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was so. For Lord Glasgow never sold
    nor gave away a horse, but had all his &ldquo;failures&rdquo;
    shot.</p>
<p>And then a great cry went up for brown
    brandy.</p>

<p>Never mind what. It was an evil man who said

    all, and the key of the street. Such is life!</p>
<p>Those experiences do not embrace a mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> combat with a &ldquo;grizzly&rdquo; in the Rockies, nor a
    tramp through a miasma-laden forest in Darkest
    Africa, with nothing better to eat than poisonous <i>fungi</i>, assorted grasses, red ants, and dwarfs; nor
    yet a bull fight. But they include roughing it
    in the bush, on underdone bread and scorched
    kangaroo, a tramp from Benares to the frontier
    of British India, another tramp or two some way
    beyond that frontier, a dreadful journey across
    the eternal snows of the Himalayas, a day&rsquo;s shooting
    in the Khyber Pass, a railway accident in
    Middlesex, a mad elephant (he had killed seven
    men, one of them blind) hunt at Thayet Myoo,
    in British Burmah, a fine snake anecdote or two,
    a night at Cambridge with an escaped lunatic, a
    tiger story (of course), and a capture for debt by
    an officer of the Sheriff of Pegu, with no other
    clothing on his body than a short jacket of gaily
    coloured silk, and a loin cloth. My life&rsquo;s history
    is never likely to be written&mdash;chiefly through
    sheer laziness on my own part, and the absence
    of the gambling instinct on that of the average
    publisher&mdash;but like the brown gentleman who
    smothered his wife, I have &ldquo;seen things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this chapter no allusion will be made to
    &ldquo;up river&rdquo; delights, the only idea of &ldquo;camping
    out&rdquo; which is properly understood by the
    majority of &ldquo;up to date&rdquo; young men and maidens;
    for this theme has been already treated, most
    comically and delightfully, by Mr. Jerome, in the
    funniest book I ever read. My own camping
    experiences have been for the most part in foreign
    lands, though I have seen the sun rise, whilst
    reclining beneath the Royal trees in St. James&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> Park; and as this book is supposed to deal with
    gastronomy, rather than adventure, a brief sketch
    of camp life must suffice.</p>
<p>On the march! What a time those who
    &ldquo;served the Widdy&rdquo;&mdash;by which disrespectful
    term, our revered Sovereign was <i>not</i> known in
    those days&mdash;used to have before the continent of
    India had been intersected by the railroad! The
    absence of one&rsquo;s proper <i>quantum</i> of rest, the forced
    marches over <i>kutcha</i> (imperfectly made) bye-roads,
    the sudden changes of temperature, raids
    of the native thief, the troubles with &ldquo;bobbery&rdquo;
    camels, the still more exasperating behaviour of
    the <i>bail-wallahs</i> (bullock-drivers), the awful
    responsibilities of the officer-on-baggage-guard,
    on active duty, often in the saddle for fifteen
    hours at a stretch, the absolutely necessary cattle-raids,
    by the roadside&mdash;all these things are well
    known to those who have undergone them, but
    are far too long &ldquo;another story&rdquo; to be related
    here. As for the food partaken of during a
    march with the regiment, the bill-of-fare differed
    but little from that of the cantonments; but the
    officer who spent a brief holiday in a shooting
    expedition had to &ldquo;rough it&rdquo; in more ways than
    one.</p>
<p>There was plenty of game all over the continent
    in my youthful days, and the average shot
    need not have lacked a dinner, even if he had not
    brought with him a consignment of &ldquo;Europe&rdquo;
    provisions. English bread was lacking, certainly,
    and biscuits, native or otherwise&mdash;&ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;
    for choice, as the bazaar article tasted principally
    of pin-cushions and the smoke of dried and lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> cow-dung&mdash;or the ordinary <i>chupatti</i>, the flat,
    unleavened cake, which the poor Indian manufactures
    for his own consumption. Cold tea is
    by far the best liquid to carry&mdash;or rather to have
    carried for you&mdash;whilst actually shooting; but
    the weary sportsman will require something
    more exciting, and more poetical, on his return
    to camp. As for solid fare it was usually</p>
<h4><i>Pepper-pot</i></h4>
<p>for dinner, day by day. We called it Pepper-pot&mdash;that
    is to say, although it differed somewhat
    from the West Indian concoction of that name,
    for which the following is the recipe:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Put the remains of any cold flesh or fowl into a
        saucepan, and cover with <i>cassaripe</i>&mdash;which has been
        already described in the Curry chapter as extract of
        Manioc root. Heat up the stew and serve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our pepper-pot was usually made in a gipsy-kettle,
    suspended from a tripod. The foundation
    of the stew was always a tin of some kind of
    soup. Then a few goat chops&mdash;mutton is bad
    to buy out in the jungle&mdash;and then any bird or
    beast that may have been shot, divided into
    fragments. I have frequently made a stew of
    this sort, with so many ingredients in it that the
    flavour when served out at table&mdash;or on the
    bullock-trunk which often did duty for a table&mdash;would
    have beaten the wit of man to describe.
    There was hare soup &ldquo;intil&rsquo;t&rdquo; (as the Scotsman
    said to the late Prince Consort), and a collop or
    two of buffalo-beef, with snipe, quails, and
    jungle-fowl. There were half the neck of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> antelope and a few sliced onions lurking within
    the bowl. And there were potatoes &ldquo;intil&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
    and plenty of pepper and salt. And for lack of
    cassaripe we flavoured the savoury mess with
    mango chutnee and Tapp sauce. And if any
    cook, English or foreign, can concoct a more
    worthy dish than this, or more grateful to the
    palate, said cook can come my way.</p>
<p>The old <i>dak gharry</i> method of travelling in
    India may well come under the head of Camping
    Out. In the hot weather we usually progressed&mdash;or
    got emptied into a ditch&mdash;or collided with
    something else, during the comparative &ldquo;coolth&rdquo;
    of the night; resting (which in Hindustan
    usually means perspiring and calling the country
    names) all day at one or other of the <i>dak bungalows</i> provided by a benevolent Government for
    the use of the wandering <i>sahib</i>. The larder at
    one of those rest-houses was seldom well filled.
    Although the <i>khansamah</i> who prostrated himself
    in the sand at your approach would declare that
    he was prepared to supply everything which the
    protector-of-the-poor might deign to order, it
    would be found on further inquiry that the <i>khansamah</i> had, like the Player Queen in Hamlet,
    protested too much&mdash;that he was a natural
    romancer. And his &ldquo;everything&rdquo; usually resolved
    itself into a &ldquo;spatch-cock,&rdquo; manufactured
    from the spectral rooster, who had heralded the
    approach of the <i>sahib&rsquo;s</i> caravan.</p>
<h4><i>A Rajah&rsquo;s</i></h4>
<p>ideas of hospitality are massive. Labouring under
    the belief that the white <i>sahib</i> when not eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> must necessarily be drinking, the commissariat
    arrangements of Rajahdom are on a colossal scale&mdash;for
    the chief benefit of his <i>major domo</i>. I
    might have bathed in dry champagne, had the
    idea been pleasing, whilst staying with a certain
    genial prince, known to irreverent British subalterns
    as &ldquo;Old Coppertail&rdquo;; whilst the bedroom
    furniture was on the same liberal scale. True,
    I lay on an ordinary native <i>charpoy</i>, which might
    have been bought in the bazaar for a few <i>annas</i>,
    but there was a grand piano in one corner of the
    apartment, and a buhl cabinet containing rare
    china in another. There was a coloured print
    of the Governor-General over the doorway, and
    an oil painting of the Judgment of Solomon over
    the mantelshelf. And on a table within easy
    reach of the bed was a silver-plated dinner
    service, decked with fruits and sweetmeats, and
    tins of salmon, and pots of Guava jelly and mixed
    pickles, and two tumblers, each of which would
    have easily held a week-old baby. And there
    was a case of champagne beneath that table, with
    every appliance for cutting wires and extracting
    the corks.</p>
<p>Another time the writer formed one of a small
    party invited to share the hospitality of a potentate,
    whose estate lay on the snowy side of Simla. The
    fleecy element, however, was not in evidence in
    June, the month of our visit, although towards
    December Simla herself is usually wrapt in the
    white mantle, and garrisoned by monkeys, who
    have fled from the land of ice. Tents had been
    erected for us in a barren-looking valley, somewhat
    famous, however, for the cultivation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> potatoes. There was an annual celebration of
    some sort, the day after our arrival, and for breakfast
    that morning an <i>al fresco</i> meal had been
    prepared for us, almost within whispering distance
    of an heathen temple. And it <i>was</i> a breakfast!
    There was a turkey stuffed with a fowl, to make
    the breast larger, and there was a &ldquo;Europe&rdquo;
    ham. A tin of lobster, a bottle of pickled
    walnuts, a dreadful concoction, alleged to be an
    omelette, but looking more like the sole of a
    tennis shoe, potatoes, boiled eggs, a dish of Irish
    stew, a fry of small fish, a weird-looking curry,
    a young goat roasted whole, and a plum pudding!</p>
<p>The tea had hardly been poured out&mdash;Kussowlie
    beer, Epps&rsquo;s cocoa, and (of course)
    champagne, and John Exshaw&rsquo;s brandy were also
    on tap&mdash;when a gentleman with very little on
    proceeded to decapitate a goat at the foot of the
    temple steps. This was somewhat startling,
    but when the (presumed) high-priest chopped
    off the head of another bleating victim, our meal
    was interrupted. The executions had been
    carried out in very simple fashion. First, the
    priest sprinkled a little water on the neck of the
    victim (who was held in position by an assistant),
    and then retired up the steps. Then, brandishing
    a small sickle, he rushed back, and in an
    instant off went the head, which was promptly
    carried, reeking with gore, within the temple.
    But if, as happened more than once, the head
    was not sliced off at the initial attempt, it was
    left on the ground when decapitation had been
    at length effected. The deity inside was evidently
    a bit particular!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>Nine goats had been sacrificed, ere our
    remonstrances were attended to; and we were
    allowed to pursue our meal in peace. But I
    don&rsquo;t think anybody had goat for breakfast that
    morning.</p>
<p>Later on, the fun of the fair commenced, and
    the <i>paharis</i>, or hill men, trooped in from miles
    round, with their sisters, cousins, and aunts.
    Their wives, we imagined, were too busily
    occupied in carrying their accustomed loads of
    timber to and fro. Your Himalayan delights in
    a fair, and the numerous swings and roundabouts
    were all well patronised; whilst the jugglers, and
    the snake charmers&mdash;in many instances it was
    difficult to tell at a glance which was charmer
    and which snake&mdash;were all well patronised.
    Later on, when the lamps had been lit, a <i>burra
    nâtch</i> was started, and the Bengali Baboos who
    had come all the way from Simla in <i>dhoolies</i> to
    be present at this, applauded vigorously. And
    our host being in constant dread lest we should
    starve to death or expire of thirst, never tired of
    bidding us to a succession of banquets at which
    we simply went through the forms of eating, to
    please him. And just when we began to get
    sleepy these simple hill folks commenced to dance
    amongst themselves. They were just a little
    monotonous, their choregraphic efforts. Parties
    of men linked arms and sidled around fires of
    logs, singing songs of their mountain homes the
    while. And as they were evidently determined
    to make a night of it, sleep for those who understood
    not the game, with their tents close handy,
    was out of the question. And when, as soon as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> could take our departure decently and decorously,
    we started up the hill again, those doleful
    monotonous dances were still in progress, although
    the fires were out, and the voices decidedly
    husky. A native of the Himalayas is
    nothing if not energetic&mdash;in his own interests be
    it understood.</p>
<p>A few months later I formed one of a small
    party who embarked on a more important
    expedition than the last named, although we
    traversed the same road. It is a journey which
    has frequently been made since, from Simla to
    Cashmere, going as far into the land of the
    Great Llama as the inhabitants will allow the
    stranger to do&mdash;which is not very far; but, in
    the early sixties there were but few white men who
    had even skirted Thibet. In the afternoon of
    life, when stirring the fire has become preferable
    to stirring adventure, it seems (to the
    writer at all events) very like an attempt at
    self-slaughter to have travelled so many hundreds
    of miles along narrow goatpaths, with a <i>khud</i> (precipice) of thousands of feet on one side or
    the other; picking one&rsquo;s way, if on foot, over
    the frequent avalanche (or &ldquo;land slip,&rdquo; as we
    called it in those days) of shale or granite; or
    if carried in a <i>dhoolie</i>&mdash;which is simply a hammock
    attached by straps to a bamboo pole&mdash;running
    the risk of being propelled over a
    precipice by your heathen carriers. It is not the
    pleasantest of sensations to cross a mountain
    torrent by means of a frail bridge (called a <i>jhula</i>)
    of ropes made from twigs, and stretched many
    feet above the torrent itself, nor to &ldquo;weather&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> a corner, whilst clinging tooth and nail to the
    face of a cliff. And when there is any riding to
    be done, most people would prefer a hill pony to
    a <i>yak</i>, the native ox of Thibet. By far the best
    part of a <i>yak</i> is his beautiful silky, fleecy tail,
    which is largely used in Hindustan, by dependants
    of governors-general, commanders-in-chief,
    and other mighty ones, for the discomfiture
    of the frequent fly. A very little equestrian
    exercise on the back of a <i>yak</i> goes a long way;
    and if given my choice, I would sooner ride a
    stumbling cab-horse in a saddle with spikes in
    it.</p>
<p>But those days were our salad ones; we were
    not only &ldquo;green of judgment,&rdquo; but admirers of
    the beautiful, and reckless of danger. But it
    was decidedly &ldquo;roughing it.&rdquo; As it is advisable
    to traverse that track as lightly laden as possible,
    we took but few &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; provisions with us,
    depending upon the villages, for the most part,
    for our supplies. We usually managed to buy
    a little flour, wherewith to make the inevitable <i>chupati</i>, and at some of the co-operative
    stores <i>en route</i>, we obtained mutton of fair
    flavour. We did not know in those days that
    flesh exposed to the air, in the higher ranges of
    the Himalayas, will not putrefy, else we should
    have doubtless made a species of <i>biltong</i> of the
    surplus meat, to carry with us in case of any
    famine about. So &ldquo;short commons&rdquo; frequently
    formed the bill of fare. Our little stock of
    brandy was carefully husbanded, against illness;
    and, judging from the subsequent histories of two
    of the party, this was the most miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> feature of the expedition. For liquid refreshment
    we had neat water, and <i>thé à la mode de
    Thibet</i>. Doctor Nansen, in his book on the
    crossing of Greenland, inveighs strongly against
    the use of alcohol in an Arctic expedition; but
    I confess that the first time I tasted Thibet tea
    I would have given both my ears for a soda and
    brandy. The raw tea was compressed into the
    shape of a brick, with the aid of&mdash;we did not
    inquire what; its infusion was drunk, either
    cold or lukewarm, flavoured with salt, and a
    small lump of butter which in any civilised
    police court would have gained the vendor a
    month&rsquo;s imprisonment without the option of a
    fine.</p>
<p>The people of the district were in the habit
    of gorging themselves with flesh when they
    could get it; and polyandry was another of their
    pleasant customs. We saw one lady who was
    married to three brothers, but did not boast of
    it. Thibet is probably the most priest-ridden
    country in the world, and ought to be the most
    religious; for the natives can grind out their
    prayers, on wheels, at short intervals, in pretty
    much the same way as we grind our coffee in
    dear old England.</p>
<p>But we reached the promised land at last;
    and here at least there was no lack of food and
    drink. Meat was cheap in those days; and one
    of the party, without any bargaining whatever,
    purchased a sheep for eight annas, or one shilling
    sterling. Mutton is not quite as cheap at the
    time of writing this book (1897), I believe; but
    in the long ago there were but few English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> visitors to the land of Lalla Rookh, and those
    who did go had to obtain permission of the
    Rajah, through the British Resident.</p>
<p>With improved transit, and a railroad from
    Rangoon to Mandalay, matters gastronomic
    may be better in British Burmah nowadays; but
    in the course of an almost world-wide experience
    I have never enjoyed food less than in Pagoda-land
    during the sixties. And as a Burmese built
    house was not a whit more comfortable than a
    tent, and far less waterproof, this subject may
    well be included in the chapter headed &ldquo;Camping
    Out.&rdquo; Fruits there were, varied and plentiful;
    and if you only planted the crown of a pine-apple
    in your compound one evening you would
    probably find a decent-sized pine-apple above
    ground next&mdash;well, next week. At least so
    they told me when I arrived in the country.
    This fruit, in fact, was so plentiful that we used
    to peel the pines, and gnaw them, just like a school-boy
    would gnaw the ordinary variety of apple.
    But we had no mutton&mdash;not up the country,
    that is to say; and we were entirely dependent
    upon Madras for potatoes. Therefore, as there
    was only a steamer once a month from Madras
    to Rangoon, which invariably missed the
    Irrawaddy monthly mail-boat, we &ldquo;exiles&rdquo; had
    to content ourselves with yams, or the abominable
    &ldquo;preserved&rdquo; earth-apple. The insects of
    the air wrestled with us at the mess-table, for
    food; and the man who did not swallow an
    evil-tasting fly of some sort in his soup was
    lucky.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> As for the food of the Burman himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> &ldquo;absolutely beastly&rdquo; was no name for it.
    Strips of cat-fish the colour of beef were served
    at his marriage feasts; and he was especially
    fond of a condiment the name of which was
    pronounced <i>nuppee</i>&mdash;although that is probably
    not the correct spelling, and I never studied
    the language of that country&mdash;which was concocted
    from a smaller description of fish, buried
    in the earth until decomposition had triumphed,
    and then mashed up with <i>ghee</i> (clarified&mdash;and
    &ldquo;postponed&rdquo;&mdash;butter). There was, certainly,
    plenty of shooting to be obtained in the district;
    but, as it rained in torrents for nine months in
    every year, the shooter required a considerable
    amount of nerve, and, in addition to a Boyton
    suit, case-hardened lungs and throat. And,
    singularly enough, it was an established fact that
    if loaded for snipe you invariably met a tiger, or
    something else with sharp teeth, and <i>vice versa</i>.
    Also, you were exceptionally fortunate if you
    did not step upon one of the venomous snakes of
    the country, of whom the <i>hamadryad&rsquo;s</i> bite was
    said to be fatal within five minutes. I had
    omitted to mention that snake is also a favourite
    food of the Burman; and as I seldom went home
    of an evening without finding a rat-snake or two
    in the verandah, or the arm-chair, the natives had
    snake for breakfast, most days. The rat-snake
    is, however, quite harmless to life.</p>
<p>I have &ldquo;camped out&rdquo; in England once or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> twice; once with a select circle of gipsies, the
    night before the Derby. I wished merely to
    study character; and, after giving them a few
    words of the Romany dialect, and a good deal of
    tobacco, I was admitted into their confidences.
    But the experience gained was not altogether
    pleasing, nor yet edifying; nor did we have
    baked hedgehog for supper. In fact I have
    never yet met the &ldquo;gippo&rdquo; (most of them keep
    fowls) who will own to having tasted this <i>bonne
    bouche</i> of the descriptive writer. Possibly this
    is on account of the scarcity of the hedgehog.
    &ldquo;Tea-kettle broth&rdquo;&mdash;bread sopped in water,
    with a little salt and dripping to flavour the soup&mdash;on
    the other hand, figures on most of the
    gipsy <i>menus</i>. And upon one occasion, very
    early in the morning, another wanderer and the
    writer obtained much-needed liquid refreshment
    by milking the yield of a Jersey cow into each
    other&rsquo;s mouths, alternately. But this was a long
    time ago, and in the neighbourhood of Bagshot
    Heath, and it was somebody else&rsquo;s cow; so let
    no more be said about it.</p>
<p>I fear this chapter is not calculated to make
    many mouths water. In fact what in the world
    has brought it into the midst of a work on gastronomy
    I am at a loss to make out. However
    here it is.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The subject of <span class="smcap">Punch</span> is such an important
    one that it may be placed first on the list of
    dainty beverages which can be made by the art
    or application of man or woman.</p>
<p>First, let us take the origin of the word. <span class="smcap">Doctor Kitchener</span>, an acknowledged authority,
    during his lifetime, on all matters connected with
    eating and drinking, has laid it down that punch
    is of West Indian origin, and that the word when
    translated, means &ldquo;five&rdquo;; because there be five
    ingredients necessary in the concoction of the
    beverage. But Doctor Kitchener and his disciples
    (of whom there be many) may go to the
    bottom of the cookery class; for although from
    the large connection which rum and limes have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> with the mixture, there would seem to be a West
    Indian flavour about it; the word &ldquo;five,&rdquo; when
    translated into West Indianese, is nothing like
    &ldquo;punch.&rdquo; Having satisfied themselves that this is a
    fact, modern authorities have tried the East Indies
    for the source of the name, and have discovered
    that <i>panch</i> in Hindustani really does mean &ldquo;five.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; says one modern authority, &ldquo;it is
    named punch from the five ingredients which
    compose it&mdash;(1) spirit, (2) acid, (3) spice, (4)
    sugar, (5) water.&rdquo; Another modern authority
    calls punch &ldquo;a beverage introduced into England
    from India, and so called from being usually
    made of five (Hindi, <i>panch</i>) ingredients&mdash;arrack,
    tea, sugar, water, and lemon juice.&rdquo; This sounds
    far more like an East Indian concoction than the
    other; but at the same time punch&mdash;during the
    latter half of the nineteenth century at all events&mdash;was
    as rare a drink in Hindustan as <i>bhang</i> in
    Great Britain. The <i>panch</i> theory is an ingenious
    one, but there are plenty of other combinations
    (both liquid and solid) of five to which the
    word punch is never applied; and about the last
    beverage recommended by the faculty for the
    consumption of the sojourner in the land of the
    Great Mogul, would, I should think, be the entrancing,
    seductive one which we Britons know
    under the name of punch. Moreover it is not
    every punch-concoctor who uses five ingredients.
    In the minds of some&mdash;youthful members of the
    Stock Exchange, for the most part&mdash;water is an
    altogether unnecessary addition to the alcoholic
    mixture which is known by the above name.
    And what manner of man would add spice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> that delight of old Ireland, &ldquo;a jug o&rsquo; punch?&rdquo;
    On the other hand, in many recipes, there are
    more than five ingredients used.</p>
<p>But after all, the origin of the name is of but
    secondary importance, as long as you can make
    punch. Therefore, we will commence with a
    few recipes for</p>
<h4><i>Milk Punch</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p> 1. Three bottles of rum.<br />
        The most delicately-flavoured rum is the &ldquo;Liquid<br />
        Sunshine&rdquo; brand.<br />
        One bottle of sherry.<br />
        13 lbs of loaf-sugar.<br />
        The rind of six lemons, and the juice of twelve.<br />
        One quart of boiling skimmed milk.<br />
    </p>
    <p>Mix together, let the mixture stand eight days,
        stirring it each day. Strain and bottle, and let it
        stand three months. Then re-bottle, and let the
        bottles lie on their sides in the cellar for two years,
        to mature. The flavour will be much better than
        if drunk after the first period of three months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not everybody, however, who would care
    to wait two years, three months, and eight days
    for the result of his efforts in punch-making.
    Therefore another recipe may be appended; and
    in this one no &ldquo;close time&rdquo; is laid down for the
    consumption of the mixture.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>2. Put into a bottle of rum or brandy the thinly-pared
        rinds of three Seville oranges, and three lemons.
        Cork tightly for two days. Rub off on 2 lbs of lump
        sugar the rinds of six lemons, squeeze the juice from
        the whole of the fruit over the 2 lbs of sugar, add
        three quarts of boiling water, one of boiling milk,
        half a teaspoonful of nutmeg, and mix all thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> well together until the sugar is dissolved. Pour in
        the rum or brandy, stir, and strain till clear; bottle
        closely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is more than one objection to this
    recipe. (1) Rum, and not brandy (by itself),
    should be used for milk punch. (2) There is an
    &ldquo;intolerable amount&rdquo; of water; and (3) the nutmeg
    had better remain in the spice-box.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>3. Cut off the thin yellow rind of four lemons
        and a Seville orange, taking care not to include even
        a fragment of the <i>white</i> rind, and place in a basin.
        Pour in one pint of Jamaica rum, and let it stand,
        covered over, twelve hours. Then strain, and mix
        with it one pint of lemon juice, and two pints of
        cold water, in which one pound of sugar-candy has
        been dissolved; add the whites of two eggs, beaten
        to a froth, three pints more of rum, one pint of
        madeira, one pint of strong green tea, and a large
        wine-glassful of maraschino. Mix thoroughly, and
        pour over all one pint of boiling milk. Let the
        punch stand a little while, then strain through a
        jelly-bag, and either use at once, or bottle off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here let it be added, lest the precept be forgotten,
    that the</p>
<h4><i>Very best Materials</i></h4>
<p>are absolutely necessary for the manufacture of
    punch, as of other compound drinks. In the
    above recipe for instance by &ldquo;madeira,&rdquo; is meant
    &ldquo;Rare Old East Indian,&rdquo; and <i>not</i> marsala,
    which wine, in French kitchens, is invariably
    used as the equivalent of madeira. There must
    be no inferior sherry, Gladstone claret, cheap
    champagne, nor potato-brandy, used for any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> my recipes, or I will not be responsible for the
    flavour of the beverage. The following is the
    best idea of a milk punch known to the writer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>4. Over the yellow rind of four lemons and one
        Seville orange, pour one pint of rum. Let it stand,
        covered over, for twelve hours. Strain and mix in
        two pints more of rum, one pint of brandy,
        one pint of sherry, half-a-pint of lemon juice,
        the expressed juice of a peeled pine-apple, one
        pint of green tea, one pound of sugar dissolved in
        one quart of boiling water, the whites of two eggs
        beaten up, one quart of boiling milk. Mix well, let
        it cool, and then strain through a jelly-bag, and
        bottle off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This punch is calculated to make the epicure
    forget that he has just been partaking of conger-eel
    broth instead of clear turtle.</p>
<h4><i>Cambridge Milk Punch.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>This a fairly good boys&rsquo; beverage, there being
        absolutely &ldquo;no offence in&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Put the rind of half
        a lemon (small) into one pint of new milk, with
        twelve lumps of sugar. Boil very slowly for fifteen
        minutes, then remove from the fire, take out the
        lemon rind, and mix in the yolk of one egg, which
        has been previously blended with one tablespoonful
        of cold milk, two tablespoonfuls of brandy, and four
        of rum. Whisk all together, and when the mixture
        is frothed, it is ready to serve.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Oxford Punch.</i></h4>
<p>There is no milk in this mixture, which
    sounds like &ldquo;for&rsquo;ard on!&rdquo; for the undergraduate
    who for the first time samples it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Rub off the yellow rind of three lemons with
        half-a-pound of loaf sugar. Put the result into a
        large jug, with the yellow rind of one Seville orange,
        the juice of three Seville oranges and eight lemons,
        and one pint of liquefied calf&rsquo;s-foot jelly. Mix
        thoroughly, then pour over two quarts of boiling
        water, and set the jug on the hob for thirty minutes.
        Strain the mixture into a punch-bowl, and when
        cool add one small bottle of capillaire (an infusion
        of maidenhair fern, flavoured with sugar and orange-flower
        water); one pint of brandy, one pint of rum,
        half-a-pint of dry sherry, and one quart of orange
        shrub&mdash;a mixture of orange-peel, juice, sugar, and
        rum.</p>

<p>After drinking this, the young student will
    be in a fit state to sally forth, with his fellows,
    and &ldquo;draw&rdquo; a Dean, or drown an amateur
    journalist.</p>
<p>I have a very old recipe, in MS., for
    &ldquo;Bischoff,&rdquo; which I take to be the original
    of the better known beverage called &ldquo;Bishop,&rdquo; for
    the manufacture of which I have also directions.
    For the sake of comparison I give the two.</p>
<h4><i>Bischoff.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Cut into four parts each, three Seville oranges,
        and slightly score the rinds across with a sharp
        knife. Roast the quarters lightly before a slow fire,
        and put them into a bowl with two bottles of claret,
        with a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Infuse this
        mixture over a slow heat for five or six hours, then
        pass it through a jelly-bag, and sweeten. It may be
        drunk hot or cold, but in any case must never be
        allowed to boil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Bishop.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Two drachmas each of cloves, mace, ginger,
        cinnamon, and allspice, boiled in half-a-pint of
        water for thirty minutes. Strain. Put a bottle of
        port in a saucepan over the fire, add the spiced
        infusion, and a lemon stuck with six cloves. Whilst
        this is heating gradually&mdash;it must not boil&mdash;take
        four ounces of loaf sugar, and with the lumps grate
        off the outer rind of a lemon into a punch-bowl.
        Add the sugar, and juice, and the hot wine, etc. Add
        another bottle of port, and serve either hot or cold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am prepared to lay a shade of odds on the
    &ldquo;op&rdquo; against the &ldquo;off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another old recipe has been quoted in some
    of my earlier public efforts, under different names.
    I have improved considerably upon the proportion
    of the ingredients, and now hand the
    whole back, under the name of</p>
<h4><i>Halo Punch</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>With a quarter pound of loaf sugar rub off the
        outer rind of one lemon and two Seville oranges. Put
        rind and sugar into a large punch-bowl with the
        juice and pulp, mix the sugar well with the juice
        and one teacupful of boiling water, and stir till cold.
        Add half-a-pint of pine-apple syrup, one pint of
        strong green tea, a claret-glassful of maraschino, a
        smaller glassful of noyeau, half-a-pint of white rum,
        one pint of brandy, and one bottle of champagne.
        Strain and serve, having, if necessary, added more
        sugar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note well the proportions. This is the same
    beverage which some Cleveland friends of mine,
    having read the recipe, thought <i>boiling</i> would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> improve. The result was&mdash;well, a considerable
    amount of chaos.</p>
<h4><i>Glasgow Punch.</i></h4>
<p>The following is from <i>Peter&rsquo;s Letters to his
    Kinsfolk</i>, and is from the pen of John Gibson
    Lockhart:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The sugar being melted with a little <i>cold</i> water,
        the artist squeezed about a dozen lemons through a
        wooden strainer, and then poured in water enough
        almost to fill the bowl. In this state the liquor goes
        by the name of sherbet, and a few of the connoisseurs
        in his immediate neighbourhood were requested to
        give their opinion of it&mdash;for in the mixing of the
        sherbet lies, according to the Glasgow creed, at least
        one-half of the whole battle. This being approved
        of by an audible smack from the lips of the umpires,
        the rum was added to the beverage, I suppose, in
        something about the proportion from one to seven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean one of sherbet and seven of
    rum, or the converse?</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Last of all, the maker cut a few limes, and running
        each section rapidly round the rim of his bowl,
        squeezed in enough of this more delicate acid to
        flavour the whole composition. In this consists the
        true <i>tour-de-maitre</i> of the punch-maker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, possibly; but it seems a plainish sort of
    punch; and unless the rum be allowed to preponderate,
    most of us would be inclined to call
    the mixture lemonade. And I do not believe
    that since Glasgow has been a city its citizens
    ever drank much of <i>that</i>.</p>
<p>A few more punches, and then an anecdote.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Ale Punch.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>One quart of mild ale in a bowl, add one wine-glassful
        of brown sherry, the same quantity of old
        brandy, a tablespoonful of sifted sugar, the peel and
        juice of one lemon, a grate of nutmeg, and an iceberg.</p>
    <p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Do not insert old ale, by mistake. And
        for my own part, I think it a mistake to mix John
        Barleycorn with wine (except champagne) and spirits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Barbadoes Punch.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>A tablespoonful of raspberry syrup, a ditto of sifted
        sugar, a wine-glassful of water, double that quantity
        of brandy, half a wine-glassful of guava jelly, liquid,
        the juice of half a lemon, two slices of orange, one
        slice of pine-apple, in a long tumbler. Ice and shake
        well and drink through straws.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Curaçoa Punch.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Put into a large tumbler one tablespoonful of
        sifted sugar, one wine-glassful of brandy, the same
        quantity of water, half a wine-glassful of Jamaica
        rum, a wine-glassful of curaçoa, and the juice of half
        a lemon; fill the tumbler with crushed ice, shake,
        and drink through straws.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Grassot Punch.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>This has nothing to do with warm asparagus, so
        have no fear. It is simply another big-tumbler
        mixture, of one wine-glassful of brandy, a liqueur-glassful
        of curaçoa, a squeeze of lemon, two teaspoonfuls
        sugar, one of syrup of strawberries, one
        wine-glassful of water, and the thin rind of a lemon;
        fill up the tumbler with crushed ice, shake, and put
        slices of ripe apricots atop. Drink how you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>Most of the above are hot-weather beverages,
    and the great beauty of some of them will be
    found in the small quantity of water in the mixture.
    Here is a punch which may be drunk in
    any weather, and either hot or cold.</p>
<h4><i>Regent Punch.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Pour into a bowl a wine-glassful of champagne,
        the same quantities of hock, curaçoa, rum, and
        madeira. Mix well, and add a pint of boiling tea,
        sweetened. Stir well and serve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Apropos</i> of the derivation of &ldquo;punch,&rdquo; I was
    unaware until quite recently that Messrs. Bradbury&rsquo;s
    &amp; Agnew&rsquo;s little paper had any connection
    therewith. But I was assured by one who knew
    all about it, that such was the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;How can the <i>London Charivari</i> possibly have anything to do
    with this most seductive of beverages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;have you
    never heard of Mark <i>Lemon</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned to smite him hip and thigh; but the
    jester had fled.</p>
<p>And now a word or two as to &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Toddy</span>.&rdquo;
    One of the authorities quoted in the punch
    difficulty declares that toddy is also an Indian
    drink. So it is. But that drink no more
    resembles what is known in more civilised lands
    as toddy than I resemble the late king Solomon.
    The palm-sap which the poor Indian distils into
    arrack and occasionally drinks in its natural state
    for breakfast after risking his neck in climbing
    trees to get it, can surely have no connection
    with hot whisky and water? Yet the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> says so; but he had best be careful ere he promulgates
    his theory in the presence of Scotsmen
    and others who possess special toddy-glasses.
    This is how I make</p>
<h4><i>Whisky Toddy</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Irish call this whisky punch. But do not
        let us wrangle over the name. Into an ordinary-sized
        tumbler which has been warmed, put one
        average lump of sugar, a ring of thin lemon peel, and
        a silver teaspoon. Fill the tumbler one quarter
        full of water as near boiling point as possible. Cover
        over until the sugar be dissolved and peel be infused.
        Then add one wine-glassful&mdash;not a small one&mdash;of the
        best whisky you can find&mdash;the &ldquo;Pollok&rdquo; brand, and
        the &ldquo;R.B.&rdquo; are both excellent. Then drink the
        toddy, or punch; for should you attempt to add any
        more water you will incur the lifelong contempt of
        every Irishman or Scotsman who may be in the
        same room. If Irish whisky be used, of course you
        will select &ldquo;John Jameson.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&rsquo;Twixt ale-flip and egg-flip there is not much
        more difference than &rsquo;twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.
        Both are equally &ldquo;more-ish&rdquo; on a cold evening;
        and no Christmas eve is complete without a jug of
        one or the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Ale-flip.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Pour into a saucepan three pints of mild ale, one
        tablespoonful of sifted sugar, a blade of mace, a clove,
        and a small piece of butter; and bring the liquor to
        a boil. Beat up in a basin the white of one egg and
        the yolks of two, mixed with about a wine-glassful of
        cold ale. Mix all together in the saucepan, then
        pour into a jug, and thence into another jug, from a
        height, for some minutes, to froth the flip thoroughly
        but do not let it get cold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Egg-flip.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Heat one pint of ale, and pour into a jug. Add
        two eggs, beaten with three ounces of sugar, and
        pour the mixture from one jug to the other, as in
        the preceding recipe. Grate a little nutmeg and
        ginger over the flip before serving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Were I to ask What is</p>
<h4><i>A Peg</i>?</h4>
<p>I should probably be told that a peg was something
    to hang something or somebody else on, or
    that it was something to be driven through or into
    something else. And the latter would be the more
    correct answer, for at the time of my sojourn in
    the great continent of India, a peg meant a
    large brandy-and-soda. At that time whisky
    was but little known in Punkahland, and was
    only used high up in the Punjaub during the
    &ldquo;cold weather&rdquo;&mdash;and it is cold occasionally in
    that region, where for some months they are
    enabled to make ice&mdash;but that is <i>une autre histoire</i>.
    Rum I once tasted at Simla, and gin will be
    dealt with presently. But since the visit of
    H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, a peg has always
    signified a <i>whisky</i>-and-soda. And yet we have
    not heard of any particular decrease in the death-rate.
    Despite what those who have only stayed
    a month or two in the country have committed
    to print, alcohol is <i>not</i> more fatal in a tropical
    country than a temperate one. But you must
    not overdo your alcohol. I have seen a gay
    young spark, a fine soldier, and over six feet in
    height, drink <i>eight</i> pegs of a morning, ere he got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> out of bed. There was no such thing as a &ldquo;split
    soda&rdquo;&mdash;or a split brandy either&mdash;in those days.
    We buried him in the Bay of Bengal just after a
    cyclone, on our way home.</p>
<p>By the way, the real meaning of &ldquo;peg&rdquo; was
    said to be the peg, or nail, driven into the coffin
    of the drinker every time he partook. And the
    coffin of many an Anglo-Indian of my acquaintance
    was all nails. A</p>
<h4><i>John Collins</i></h4>
<p>is simply a gin-sling with a little curaçoa in it.
    That is to say, soda-water, a slice of lemon,
    curaçoa&mdash;and gin. But by altering the proportions
    this can be made a very dangerous potion
    indeed. The officers of a certain regiment&mdash;which
    shall be nameless&mdash;were in the habit of
    putting this potion on tap, after dinner on a
    guest night. It was a point of honour in those
    evil, though poetical, times, to send no guest
    empty away, and more than one of those entertained
    by this regiment used to complain next
    morning at breakfast&mdash;a peg, or a swizzle, and a
    hot pickle sandwich&mdash;of the escape of &ldquo;Private
    John Collins&rdquo; from the regimental guard-room.
    For towards dawn there would not be much
    soda-water in that potion&mdash;which was usually
    served hot at that hour.</p>

<p>Here is a less expensive recipe:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><i>B.</i> Put into a bowl the rind of one lemon pared
        very thin, add some sifted sugar, and pour over it a
        wine-glassful of sherry; then add a bottle of claret,
        more sugar to taste, a sprig of verbena, one bottle of
        aerated water, and a grated nutmeg; strain and ice
        it well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more let the fact be emphasised that the
    better the wine, spirit, etc., the better the cup.</p>
<p>Here is a good cup for Ascot, when the sun
    is shining, and you are entertaining the fair sex.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><i>C.</i> Put in a large bowl three bottles of claret (St.
        Estephe is the stamp of wine), a wine-glassful (large)
        of curaçoa, a pint of dry sherry, half a pint of old
        brandy, a large wine-glassful of raspberry syrup, three
        oranges and one lemon cut into slices; add a few
        sprigs of borage and a little cucumber rind, two
        bottles of seltzer water, and three bottles of Stretton
        water. Mix well, and sweeten. Let it stand for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> hour, and then strain. Put in a large block of ice, and
        a few whole strawberries. Serve in small tumblers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way and a simpler:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><i>D.</i> Pour into a large jug one bottle of claret, add
        two wine-glassfuls of sherry, and half a glass of maraschino.
        Add a few sliced nectarines, or peaches, and
        sugar to taste (about a tablespoonful and a half).
        Let it stand till the sugar is dissolved, then put in a
        sprig of borage. Just before using add one bottle of
        Stretton water, and a large piece of ice.</p>

<p>My ideal claret cup:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> <i>E.</i> 2 bottles Pontet Canet.<br />
        <span style="margin-left:1em">2 wine-glassfuls old brandy.<br />
        </span> <span style="margin-left:1em">1 wine-glassful curaçoa.<br />

        </span> <span style="margin-left:1em">2 bottles aerated water.</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sprig or two of borage, and a little lemon peel.</p>
<p>Sugar <i>ad lib.</i>: one cup will not require much.</p>
<p>Add the moselle and popwater just before using;
    then put in a large block of ice.</p>
<p>Those who have never tried can have no idea
    of the zest which a small proportion of moselle
    lends to a claret cup.</p>
<p>My earliest recollection of a cup dates from old
    cricketing days beneath &ldquo;Henry&rsquo;s holy shade,&rdquo;
    on &ldquo;a match day&rdquo;&mdash;as poor old &ldquo;Spanky&rdquo; used
    to phrase it; a day on which that prince of
    philosophers and confectioners sold his wares for
    cash only. Not that he had anything to do
    with the compounding of the</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Toast a slice of bread and put it at the bottom of
        a large jug. Grate over the toast nearly half a small
        nutmeg, and a very little ginger. Add a little thin
        lemon rind, and six lumps of sugar. Then add two
        wine-glasses of sherry, and (if for adults) one of brandy.
        (If for boys the brandy in the sherry will suffice.)
        Add also the juice of a small lemon, two bottles of
        lively water, and (last of all) three pints of cider.
        Mix well, pop in a few sprigs of borage, and a block
        or two of ice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember once more that the purer the
    cider the better will be the cup. There is an
    infinity of bad cider in the market. There used
    to be a prejudice against the fermented juice of
    the apple for all who have gouty tendencies;
    but as a &ldquo;toe-martyr&rdquo; myself, I can bear testimony
    to the harmlessness of the &ldquo;natural&rdquo;

<p>This is a very serious affair. So was the war.
    The cup, however, leads to more favourable
    results, and does not, like the campaign, leave a
    bitter taste in the mouth. Here are the ingredients:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>One quart of syrup of orgeat (to make this <i>vide</i> next recipe), one pint and a half of old brandy, half
        a pint of maraschino, one pint of old rum, two large
        and one small bottles of champagne, three bottles of
        Seltzer-water, half-a-pound of sifted sugar, and the
        juice of five lemons. Peel the lemons, and put the
        thin rind in a mortar, with the sugar. Pound them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> well, and scrape the result with a silver spoon into
        a large bowl. Squeeze in the juice of the lemons,
        add the seltzer water, and stir till the sugar is quite
        dissolved. Then add the orgeat, and whip the
        mixture well with a whisk, so as to whiten it. Add
        the maraschino, rum, and brandy, and strain the whole
        into another bowl. Just before the cup is required,
        put in the champagne, and stir vigorously with a
        punch ladle. The champagne should be well iced,
        as no apparent ice is allowable in this mixture.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Blanch and pound three-quarters of a pound of
        sweet almonds, and thirty bitter almonds, in one
        tablespoonful of water. Stir in by degrees two pints
        of water and three pints of milk. Strain the mixture
        through a cloth. Dissolve half-a-pound of loaf
        sugar in one pint of water. Boil and skim well, and
        then mix with the almond water. Add two tablespoonfuls
        of orange-flower water, and half-a-pint of
        old brandy. Be careful to boil the <i>eaû sucré</i> well, as
        this concoction must not be too watery.</p>

<h4><i>Ascot Cup.</i></h4>
<p>Odds can be laid freely on this; and the host
    should stay away from the temptations of the
    betting-ring, on purpose to make it. And&mdash;parenthetically
    be it observed&mdash;the man who has
    no soul for cup-making should never entertain at
    a race meeting. The servants will have other
    things to attend to; and even if they have not

<p>How many people, I wonder, are aware that</p>

<p>make one of the best combinations possible?
    You may search the wide wide world for a

    and is, moreover, far to be preferred to what
    is known as</p>
<h4><i>Rich Man&rsquo;s Shandy Gaff</i>,</h4>
<p>which is a mixture of champagne and ale. The
    old Irishman said that the &ldquo;blackgyard&rdquo; should
    never be placed atop of the &ldquo;gintleman,&rdquo; intending
    to convey the advice that ale should not
    be placed on the top of champagne. But the
    &ldquo;black draught&rdquo; indicated just above is well
    worth attention. It should be drunk out of a
    pewter tankard, and is specially recommended
    as a between-the-acts refresher for the amateur

<h4><i>Cordials.</i></h4>
<p>In treating of cordials, it is most advisable that
    they be <i>home made</i>. The bulk of the cherry
    brandy, ginger brandy, etc., which is sold over
    the counter is made with inferior brandy; and
    frequently the operation of blending the virtue of
    the fruit with the spirit has been hurried.</p>
<p>We will commence with the discussion of the
    favourite cordial of all,</p>
<h4><i>Cherry Brandy</i>.</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>This can either be made from Black Gean
        cherries, or Morellas, but the latter are better for
        the purpose. Every pound of cherries will require
        one quarter of a pound of white sugar, and one pint
        of the best brandy. The cherries, with the sugar
        well mixed with them, should be placed in wide-mouthed
        bottles, filled up with brandy; and if the
        fruit be previously pricked, the mixture will be
        ready in a month. But a better blend is procured
        if the cherries are untouched, and this principle holds
        good with all fruit treated in this way, and left
        corked for at least three months.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Sloe Gin.</i></h4>
<p>For years the sloe, which is the fruit of the
    black-thorn, was used in England for no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> purpose than the manufacture of British Port.
    But at this end of the nineteenth century, the
    public have been, and are, taking kindly to the
    cordial, which for a long time had been despised
    as an &ldquo;auld wife&rsquo;s drink.&rdquo; As a matter of fact,
    it is just as tasty, and almost as luscious as cherry
    brandy. But since sloe gin became fashionable,
    it has become almost impossible for dwellers
    within twenty or thirty miles of London to make
    the cordial at home. For sloes fetch something
    like sixpence or sevenpence a pound in the market;
    and in consequence the hedgerows are &ldquo;raided&rdquo;
    by the (otherwise) unemployed, the fruit being
    usually picked before the proper time, <i>i.e.</i> when
    the frost has been on it. The manufacture of sloe
    gin is as simple as that of cherry brandy.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>All that is necessary to be done is to allow 1
        lb. of sugar (white) to 1 lb. of sloes. Half fill
        a bottle&mdash;which need not necessarily be a wide-mouthed
        one&mdash;with sugared fruit, and &ldquo;top up&rdquo;
        with gin. If the sloes have been pricked, the liquor
        will be ready for use in two or three months; but <i>do not hurry it</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a year&rsquo;s time the gin will have eaten all the
    goodness out of the unpricked fruit, and it is in
    this gradual blending that the secret (as before
    observed) of making these cordials lies. As a
    rule, if you call for sloe gin at a licensed house of
    entertainment, you will get a ruby-coloured
    liquid, tasting principally of gin&mdash;and not good
    gin &ldquo;at that.&rdquo; This is because the making has
    been hurried. Properly matured sloe gin should
    be the colour of full-bodied port wine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Apricot Brandy.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>This is a cordial which is but seldom met with
        in this country. To every pound of fruit (which
        should not be quite ripe) allow one pound of
        loaf sugar. Put the apricots into a preserving-pan,
        with sufficient water to cover them. Let them
        boil up, and then simmer gently until tender.
        Remove the skins. Clarify and boil the sugar, then
        pour it over the fruit. Let it remain twenty-four
        hours. Then put the apricots into wide-mouthed
        bottles, and fill them up with syrup and brandy,
        half and half. Cork them tightly, with the tops of
        corks sealed. This apricot brandy should be prepared
        in the month of July, and kept twelve months
        before using.</p>

<h4><i>Highland Cordial.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Here is another rare old recipe. Ingredients,
        one pint of white currants, stripped of their stalks,
        the thin rind of a lemon, one teaspoonful of essence
        of ginger, and one bottle of old Scotch whisky.
        Let the mixture stand for forty-eight hours, and
        then strain through a hair sieve. Add one pound of
        loaf sugar, which will take at least a day to thoroughly
        dissolve. Then bottle off, and cork well. It will
        be ready for use in three months, but will keep
        longer.</p>

        gentian root. Put them in a wide-mouthed bottle,
        and cover with brandy or whisky. Let the mixture
        remain for twelve days, then strain, and bottle off
        for use, after adding one ounce of lavender drops.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It should be made in the month of March.
        Take the thin rinds of six Seville oranges, and put
        them into a stone jar, with half-a-pint of the strained
        juice, and two quarts of good old brandy. Let it
        remain three days, then add one pound and a quarter
        of loaf sugar&mdash;broken, not pounded&mdash;and stir till
        the sugar is dissolved. Let the liquor stand a day,
        strain it through paper till quite clear, pour into
        bottles, and cork tightly. The longer it is kept the

<p>Whilst holding the same opinion as the epicure
    who declared that good eating required good drinking,
    there is no question but that there should
    be a limit to both. There is, as Shakespeare
    told us, a tide in the affairs of man, so why should
    there not be in this particular affair? Why
    should it be only ebb tide during the few hours
    that the man is wrapped in the arms of a
    Bacchanalian Morpheus, either in bed or in
    custody? The abuse of good liquor is surely as
    criminal a folly as the abstention therefrom; and
    the man who mixes his liquors injudiciously
    lacks that refinement of taste and understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> which is necessary for the appreciation of a good

    most part, the best of ale, and such port wine as
    is not to be had in these days of free trade
    (which is only an euphemism for adulteration)
    and motor cars. Although mine own teeth are,
    periodically, set on edge by the juice of the grape
    consumed by an ancestor or two; although the
    gout within me is an heritage from the three-,
    aye! and four-, bottle era, I respect mine ancestors,
    in that they knew not &ldquo;gin and bitters.&rdquo; The
    baleful habit of alcoholising the inner sinner between
    meal times, the pernicious habit of dram-drinking,
    or &ldquo;nipping,&rdquo; from early morn till
    dewy eve, was not introduced into our cities
    until the latter half of the nineteenth century
    had set in. &ldquo;Brandy-and-soda,&rdquo; at first only used
    as a &ldquo;livener&rdquo;&mdash;and a deadly livener it is&mdash;was
    unknown during the early Victorian era; and
    the &ldquo;gin-crawl,&rdquo; that interminable slouch around
    the hostelries, is a rank growth of modernity.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;nipping habit&rdquo; came to us, with other
    pernicious &ldquo;notions,&rdquo; from across the Atlantic
    Ocean. It was Brother Jonathan who established
    the bar system; and although for the most part,
    throughout Great Britain, the alcohol is dispensed
    by young ladies with fine eyes and a
    great deal of adventitious hair, and the &ldquo;bar-keep,&rdquo;
    with his big watch chain, and his &ldquo;guns,&rdquo;
    placed within easy reach, for quick-shooting
    saloon practice, is unknown on this side, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> hurt of the system (to employ an Americanism)
    &ldquo;gets there just the same.&rdquo; There is not the
    same amount of carousing in the British army
    as in the days when I was a &ldquo;gilded popinjay&rdquo;
    (in the language of Mr. John Burns; &ldquo;a five-and-twopenny
    assassin,&rdquo; in the words of somebody
    else). In those days the use of alcohol, if
    not absolutely encouraged for the use of the
    subaltern, was winked at by his superiors, as
    long as the subalterns were not on duty, or on
    the line of march&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know so much
    about the line of march, either. But with any
    orderly or responsible duty to be done, the
    beverage of heroes was not admired. &ldquo;Now
    mind,&rdquo; once observed our revered colonel, in the
    ante-room, after dinner, &ldquo;none of you young
    officers get seeing snakes and things, or otherwise
    rendering yourselves unfit for service; or I&rsquo;ll try
    the lot of you by court martial, I will, by &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
    Here the adjutant let the regimental bible drop
    with a bang. Tea is the favourite ante-room
    refreshment nowadays, when the officer, young
    or old, is always either on duty, or at school.
    And the education of the modern warrior is never
    completed.</p>
<p>But the civilian&mdash;sing ho! the wicked
    civilian&mdash;is a reveller, and a winebibber, for the
    most part. Very little business is transacted
    except over what is called &ldquo;a friendly glass.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;I want seven hundred an&rsquo; forty-five from you,
    old chappie,&rdquo; says Reggie de Beers of the &ldquo;House,&rdquo;
    on settling day. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; replies his friend
    young &ldquo;Berthas&rdquo;: &ldquo;toss you double or quits.
    Down with it!&rdquo; And it would be a cold day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> were not a magnum or two of &ldquo;the Boy&rdquo; to be
    opened over the transaction. The cheap eating-house
    keeper who has spent his morning at the
    &ldquo;market,&rdquo; cheapening a couple of pigs, or a dozen
    scraggy fowls, will have spent double the money
    he has saved in the bargain, in rum and six-penny
    ale, ere he gets home again; and even a
    wholesale deal in evening journals, between two
    youths in the street, requires to be &ldquo;wetted.&rdquo;
    Very sad is it not? But, as anything which I&mdash;who
    am popularly supposed to be something
    resembling a roysterer, but who am in reality one
    of the most discreet of those who enjoy life&mdash;can
    write is not likely to work a change in the
    system which obtains amongst English-speaking
    nations, perhaps the sooner I get on with the
    programme the better. Later on I may revert
    to the subject.</p>
<p>Amongst daylight (and midnight, for the
    matter of that) drinks, the <span class="smcap">Cocktail</span>, that
    fascinating importation from Dollarland, holds a
    prominent place. This is a concoction for
    which, with American bars all over the Metropolis,
    the cockney does not really require any
    recipe. But as I trust to have some country
    readers, a few directions may be appended.</p>
<h4><i>Brandy Cocktail.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>One wine-glassful of old brandy, six drops of
        Angostura bitters, and twenty drops of curaçoa, in
        a small tumbler&mdash;all cocktails should be made in

        crushed ice, and as much champagne as the tumbler
        will hold. Mix with a spoon.</p>

        of best ice, one teaspoonful of sifted sugar, one
        teaspoonful of orange bitters, half a wine-glassful of
        brandy. Top up with bottled cider, and mix with
        a spoon. Serve with a strawberry, and a sprig of
        verbena atop.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Manhattan Cocktail.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Half a wine-glassful of vermouth (Italian), half
        a wine-glassful of rye whisky (according to the
        American recipe, though, personally, I prefer Scotch),
        ten drops of Angostura bitters, and six drops of
        curaçoa. Add ice, shake well, and strain. Put a
        shred of lemon peel atop.</p>

        brandy. Stir well, and serve with peel atop.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Saratoga Cocktail.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>This is a more important affair, and requires a
        large tumbler for the initial stage. One teaspoonful
        of pine-apple syrup, ten drops of Angostura bitters,
        one teaspoonful of maraschino, and a wine-glassful of
        old brandy. Nearly fill the tumbler with crushed
        ice, and shake well. Then place a couple of strawberries
        in a small tumbler, strain the liquid on them,
        put in a strip of lemon peel, and top up with
        champagne.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Whisky Cocktail.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Put into a small tumbler ten drops of Angostura
        bitters, and one wine-glassful of Scotch whisky. Fill

<p>But the ordinary British &ldquo;bar-cuddler&rdquo;&mdash;as
    he is called in the slang of the day&mdash;recks not of
    cocktails, nor, indeed, of Columbian combinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> of any sort. He has his own particular &ldquo;vanity,&rdquo;
    and frequently a pet name for it. &ldquo;Gin-and-angry-story&rdquo;
    (Angostura), &ldquo;slow-and-old&rdquo; (sloe-gin
    and Old Tom), &ldquo;pony o&rsquo; Burton, please
    miss,&rdquo; are a few of the demands the attentive
    listener may hear given. Orange-gin, gin-and-orange-gin,
    gin-and-sherry (O bile where is thy
    sting?), are favourite midday &ldquo;refreshers&rdquo;; and
    I have heard a well-known barrister call for
    &ldquo;a split Worcester&rdquo; (a small wine-glassful of
    Worcester sauce with a split soda), without a
    smile on his expressive countenance. &ldquo;Small lem.
    and a dash&rdquo; is a favourite summer beverage, and,
    withal, a harmless one, consisting of a small
    bottle of lemonade with about an eighth of a
    pint of bitter ale added thereto. In one old-fashioned
    hostelry I wot of&mdash;the same in which
    the chair of the late Doctor Samuel Johnson is
    on view&mdash;customers who require to be stimulated
    with gin call for &ldquo;rack,&rdquo; and Irish whisky is
    known by none other name than &ldquo;Cork.&rdquo; The
    habitual &ldquo;bar-cuddler&rdquo; usually rubs his hands
    violently together, as he requests a little attention
    from the presiding Hebe; and affects a sort of
    shocked surprise at the presence on the scene of
    any one of his friends or acquaintances. He is
    well-up, too, in the slang phraseology of the day,
    which he will ride to death on every available
    opportunity. Full well do I remember him in
    the &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your poor feet?&rdquo; era; and it seems
    but yesterday that he was informing the company
    in assertive tones, &ldquo;Now we <i>shan&rsquo;t</i> be long!&rdquo;
    The &ldquo;free lunch&rdquo; idea of the Yankees is only
    thoroughly carried out in the &ldquo;North Countree,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> where, at the best hotels, there is often a great
    bowl of soup, or a dish of jugged hare, or of
    Irish stew, <i>pro bono publico</i>; and by <i>publico</i> is
    implied the hotel directorate as well as the
    customers. In London, however, the free lunch
    seldom soars above salted almonds, coffee beans,
    cloves, with biscuits and American cheese. But
    at most refreshment-houses is to be obtained for
    cash some sort of a restorative sandwich, or <i>bonne
    bouche</i>, in the which anchovies and hard-boiled
    eggs play leading parts; and amongst other restorative
    food, I have noticed that parallelograms
    of cold Welsh rarebit are exceedingly popular
    amongst wine-travellers and advertisement-agents.
    The genius who propounded the statement that
    &ldquo;there is nothing like leather&rdquo; could surely
    never have sampled a cold Welsh rarebit!</p>
<h4><i>Bosom Caresser.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Put into a small tumbler one wine-glassful of sherry,
        half a wine-glassful of old brandy, the yolk of an egg,
        two teaspoonfuls of sugar, and two grains of cayenne
        pepper; add crushed ice, shake well, strain, and
        dust over with nutmeg and cinnamon.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>A Nicobine</i>,</h4>
<p>(or &ldquo;Knickerbein&rdquo; as I have seen it spelt), used
    to be a favourite &ldquo;short&rdquo; drink in Malta, and
    consisted of the yolk of an egg (intact) in a
    wine-glass with <i>layers</i> of curaçoa, maraschino,
    and green chartreuse; the liquors not allowed to
    mix with one another. The &ldquo;knickerbein&rdquo;
    recipe differs materially from this, as brandy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> substituted for chartreuse, and the ingredients
    are shaken up and strained, the white of the egg
    being whisked and placed atop. But, either way,
    you will get a good, bile-provoking mixture.

<p>is compounded, according to a favourite author,

    <p>&ldquo;Upon virgin honeycombs you pour, according
        to their amount, the oldest French brandy and the
        most indisputable Scotch whisky in equal proportions.
        You allow this goodly mixture to stand
        for days in a large pipkin in a cool place, and it is
        then strained and ready for drinking. Epicures
        drop into the jug, by way of imparting artistic
        finish, a small fragment of the honeycomb itself.
        This I deprecate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most wholesome of all &ldquo;refreshers,&rdquo;

<h4><i>Cassis.</i></h4>
<p>This syrup can be obtained in the humblest <i>cabaret</i> in France; but we have to thank the
    eccentric and illogical ways of our Customs
    Department for its absence from most of our own
    wine lists. The duty is so prohibitive&mdash;being
    half as much again as that levied on French
    brandy&mdash;that it would pay nobody but said
    Customs Department to import it into England;
    and yet the amount of alcohol contained in cassis
    is infinitesimal. Strange to say nobody has ever
    started a cassis still on this side. One would
    imagine that the process would be simplicity
    itself; as the liquor is nothing but cold black-currant
    tea, with a suspicion of alcohol in it.</p>
<h4><i>Sligo Slop.</i></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>This is an Irish delight. The juice of ten
        lemons, strained, ten tablespoonfuls of sifted sugar,
        one quart of John Jameson&rsquo;s oldest and best whisky,
        and two port wine-glassfuls of curaçoa, all mixed together.
        Let the mixture stand for a day or two,
        and then bottle. This should be drunk neat, in
        liqueur-glasses, and is said to be most effectual
        &ldquo;jumping-powder.&rdquo; It certainly reads conducive to
        timber-topping.</p>

<p>Take it altogether the daylight drink is a
    mistake. It is simply ruin to appetite; it is
    more expensive than those who indulge therein
    are aware of at the time. It ruins the nerves,
    sooner or later; it is <i>not</i> conducive to business,
    unless for those whose heads are especially hard;
    and it spoils the palate for the good wine which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> is poured forth later on. The precept cannot be
    too widely laid down, too fully known:</p>

<p>Considering the number of books which have
    been published during the nineteenth century, it is
    astonishing how few of them deal with eating
    and drinking. We read of a banquet or two,
    certainly, in the works of the divine William,
    but no particulars as to the <i>cuisine</i> are entered
    into. &ldquo;Cold Banquo&rdquo; hardly sounds appetising.
    Thomas Carlyle was a notorious dyspeptic, so it
    is no cause for wonderment that he did not
    bequeath to posterity the recipes for a dainty
    dish or two, or a good Derby Day &ldquo;Cup.&rdquo;
    Thackeray understood but little about cookery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> nor was Whyte Melville much better versed in
    the mysteries of the kitchen. Harrison Ainsworth
    touched lightly on gastronomy occasionally,
    whilst Charles Lamb, Sydney Smith,
    and others (blessings light on the man who invented
    the phrase &ldquo;and others&rdquo;) delighted
    therein. Miss Braddon has slurred it over
    hitherto, and Marie Corelli scorns all mention
    of any refreshment but absinthe&mdash;a weird liquid
    which is altogether absent from these pages. In
    the lighter novels of Mr. F. C. Philips, there is
    but little mention of solid food except devilled
    caviare, which sounds nasty; but most of Mr.
    Philips&rsquo;s men, and all his women, drink to excess&mdash;principally
    champagne, brandy, and green chartreuse.
    And one of his heroines is a firm
    believer in the merits of cognac as a &ldquo;settler&rdquo; of
    champagne.</p>
<p>According to Mr. R. D. Blackmore, the natives
    of Exmoor did themselves particularly well, in the
    seventeenth century. In that most delightful
    romance <i>Lorna Doone</i> is a description of a meal
    set before Tom Faggus, the celebrated highwayman,
    by the Ridd family, at Plover&rsquo;s Barrows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;A few oysters first, and then dried salmon, and
        then ham and eggs, done in small curled rashers,
        and then a few collops of venison toasted, and next
        a little cold roast pig, and a woodcock on toast to
        finish with.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This meal was washed down with home-brewed
    ale, followed by Schiedam and hot water.</p>
<p>One man, and one man alone, who has left
    his name printed deep on the sands of time
    as a writer, thoroughly revelled in the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> subjects of eating and drinking. Need his name
    be mentioned? What is, after all, the great
    secret of the popularity of</p>
<h4><i>Charles Dickens</i></h4>
<p>as a novelist? His broad, generous views on the
    subject of meals, as expressed through the
    mouths of most of the characters in his works;
    as also the homely nature of such meals, and
    the good and great deeds to which they led.
    I once laid myself out to count the number of
    times that alcoholic refreshment is mentioned
    in some of the principal works of the great
    author; and the record, for <i>Pickwick</i> alone, was
    sufficient to sweep from the surface of the earth,
    with its fiery breath, the entire Blue Ribbon
    Army. Mr. Pickwick was what would be
    called nowadays a &ldquo;moderate drinker.&rdquo; That is
    to say, he seldom neglected an &ldquo;excuse for a
    lotion,&rdquo; nor did he despise the &ldquo;daylight drink.&rdquo;
    But we only read of his being overcome by his
    potations on two occasions; after the cricket
    dinner at Muggleton, and after the shooting
    luncheon on Captain Boldwig&rsquo;s ground. And
    upon the latter occasion I am convinced that the
    hot sun had far more to do with his temporary
    obfuscation than the cold punch. Bob Sawyer
    and Ben Allen were by no means exaggerated
    types of the medical students of the time. The
    &ldquo;deputy sawbones&rdquo; of to-day writes pamphlets,
    drinks coffee, and pays his landlady every
    Saturday. And it was a happy touch of Dickens
    to make Sawyer and Allen eat oysters, and wash
    them down with neat brandy, before breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> I have known medical students, aye! and full-blown
    surgeons too, who would commit equally
    daring acts; although I doubt much if they
    would have shone at the breakfast-table afterwards,
    or on the ice later in the day. For the
    effect exercised by brandy on oysters is pretty
    well known to science.</p>
<p>Breathes there a man with soul so dead as not
    to appreciate the delights of Dingley Dell? Free
    trade and other horrors have combined to crush
    the British yeoman of to-day; but we none the
    less delight to read of him as he was, and I do
    not know a better cure for an attack of &ldquo;blue
    devils&rdquo;&mdash;or should it be &ldquo;black dog?&rdquo;&mdash;than a
    good dose of Dingley Dell. The wholesale
    manner in which Mr. Wardle takes possession
    of the Pickwickians&mdash;only one of whom he
    knows intimately&mdash;for purposes of entertainment,
    is especially delightful, and worthy of
    imitation; and I can only regret the absence
    of a good, cunningly-mixed &ldquo;cup&rdquo; at the
    picnic after the Chatham review. The wine
    drunk at this picnic would seem to have been
    sherry; as there was not such a glut of &ldquo;the
    sparkling&rdquo; in those good old times. And the
    prompt way in which &ldquo;Emma&rdquo; is commanded
    to &ldquo;bring out the cherry brandy,&rdquo; before his
    guests have been two minutes in the house,
    bespeaks the character of dear old Wardle in
    once. &ldquo;The Leathern Bottle,&rdquo; a charming old-world
    hostelry in that picturesque country lying
    between Rochester and Cobham, would hardly
    have been in existence now, let alone doing a
    roaring trade, but for the publication of <i>Pickwick</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> and the notion of the obese Tupman
    solacing himself for blighted hopes and taking
    his leave of the world on a diet of roast fowl
    bacon, ale, etc., is unique. The bill-of-fare at
    the aforementioned shooting luncheon might
    not, perhaps, satisfy the aspirations of Sir Mota
    Kerr, or some other <i>nouveau riche</i> of to-day, but
    there was plenty to eat and drink. Here is the
    list, in Mr. Samuel Weller&rsquo;s own words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weal pie, tongue: a wery good thing when
    it ain&rsquo;t a woman&rsquo;s: bread, knuckle o&rsquo; ham, reg&rsquo;lar
    picter, cold beef in slices; wery good. What&rsquo;s
    in them stone jars, young touch-and-go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beer in this one,&rdquo; replied the boy, taking
    from his shoulder a couple of large stone bottles,
    fastened together by a leathern strap, &ldquo;cold punch
    in t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a wery good notion of a lunch it is,
    take it altogether,&rdquo; said Mr. Weller.</p>
<p>Possibly; though cold beef in slices would be
    apt to get rather dryer than was desirable on a
    warm day. And milk punch hardly seems the
    sort of tipple to encourage accuracy of aim.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s notion of a nice little supper
    we gather from the same immortal work, was &ldquo;a
    couple of sets of pettitoes and some toasted cheese.&rdquo;
    The pettitoes were presumably simmered in milk,
    and the cheese was, undoubtedly, &ldquo;browning away
    most delightfully in a little Dutch oven in front of
    the fire.&rdquo; Most of us will smack our lips after this
    description; though details are lacking as to the
    contents of the &ldquo;black bottle&rdquo; which was produced
    from &ldquo;a small closet.&rdquo; But amongst students
    of <i>Pickwick</i>, &ldquo;Old Tom&rdquo; is a hot favourite.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>The Deputy Shepherd&rsquo;s particular &ldquo;vanity&rdquo;
    appears to have been buttered toast and reeking
    hot pine-apple rum and water, which sounds like
    swimming-in-the-head; and going straight
    through the book, we next pause at the description
    of the supper given by the medical
    students, at their lodgings in the Borough, to
    the Pickwickians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man to whom the order for the oysters
    had been sent had not been told to open them;
    it is a very difficult thing to open an oyster with
    a limp knife or a two-pronged fork; and very
    little was done in this way. Very little of the
    beef was done either; and the ham (which was
    from the German-sausage shop round the corner)
    was in a similar predicament. However, there
    was plenty of porter in a tin can; and the cheese
    went a great way, for it was very strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably the oysters had not been paid for in
    advance, and the man imagined that they would
    be returned upon his hands none the worse. For
    at that time&mdash;as has been remarked before, in
    this volume on gastronomy&mdash;the knowledge that
    an oyster baked in his own shells, in the middle
    of a clear fire, is an appetising dish, does not
    appear to have been universal.</p>
<p>It is questionable if a supper consisting of a
    boiled leg of mutton &ldquo;with the usual trimmings&rdquo;
    would have satisfied the taste of the &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s
    gentleman&rdquo; of to-day, who is a hypercritic, if
    anything; but let that supper be taken as read.
    Also let it be noted that the appetite of the
    redoubtable Pickwick never seems to have failed
    him, even in the sponging-house&mdash;five to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> can be betted that those chops were <i>fried</i>&mdash;or in
    the Fleet Prison itself. And mention of this
    establishment recalls the extravagant folly of Job
    Trotter (who of all men ought to have known
    better) in purchasing &ldquo;a small piece of raw loin
    of mutton&rdquo; for the refection of himself and ruined
    master; when for the same money he could surely
    have obtained a sufficiency of bullock&rsquo;s cheek or
    liver, potatoes, and onions, to provide dinner for
    three days. <i>Vide</i> the &ldquo;Kent Road Cookery,&rdquo; in
    one of my earlier chapters. The description of
    the journeys from Bristol to Birmingham, and
    back to London, absolutely reeks with food and
    alcohol; and it has always smacked of the mysterious
    to myself how Sam Weller, a pure Cockney,
    could have known so much of the capacities
    of the various hostelries on the road. Evidently
    his knowledge of other places besides London was
    &ldquo;peculiar.&rdquo; Last scene of all in <i>Pickwick</i> requiring
    mention here, is the refection given to Mr.
    Solomon Pell in honour of the proving of the
    late Dame Weller&rsquo;s last will and testament.
    &ldquo;Porter, cold beef, and oysters,&rdquo; were some of the
    incidents of that meal, and we read that &ldquo;the
    coachman with the hoarse voice took an imperial
    pint of vinegar with his oysters, without betraying
    the least emotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is also set down that brandy and water, as
    usual in this history, followed the oysters; but
    we are not told if any of those coachmen ever
    handled the ribbons again, or if Mr. Solomon
    Pell spent his declining days in the infirmary.</p>
<p>In fact, there are not many chapters in Charles
    Dickens&rsquo; works in which the knife and fork do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> not play prominent parts. The food is, for the
    most part, simple and homely; the seed sown in
    England by the fairy <i>Ala</i> had hardly begun
    to germinate at the time the novels were written.
    Still there is, naturally, a suspicion of <i>Ala</i> at the
    very commencement of <i>Little Dorrit</i>, the scene
    being laid in the Marseilles prison, where Monsieur
    Rigaud feasts off Lyons sausage, veal in savoury
    jelly, white bread, strachino cheese, and good
    claret, the while his humble companion, Signor
    John Baptist, has to content himself with stale
    bread, through reverses at gambling with his
    fellow prisoner. After that, there is no mention
    of a &ldquo;square meal&rdquo; until we get to Mr. Casby&rsquo;s,
    the &ldquo;Patriarch.&rdquo; &ldquo;Everything about the patriarchal
    household,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;promoted quiet
    digestion&rdquo;; and the dinner mentioned began
    with &ldquo;some soup, some fried soles, a butter-boat
    of shrimp sauce, and a dish of potatoes.&rdquo; Rare
    old Casby! &ldquo;Mutton, a steak, and an apple
    pie&rdquo;&mdash;and presumably cheese&mdash;furnished the
    more solid portion of the banquet, which appears
    to have been washed down with porter and sherry
    wine, and enlivened by the inconsequent remarks
    of &ldquo;Mr. F.&rsquo;s Aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <i>Great Expectations</i> occurs the celebrated
    banquet at the Chateau Gargery on Christmas
    Day, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and
    greens, a pair of roast stuffed fowls, a handsome
    mince pie, and a plum-pudding. The absence
    of the savoury pork-pie, and the presence of
    tar-water in the brandy are incidents at that
    banquet familiar enough to Sir Frank Lockwood,
    Q.C., M.P., and other close students of Dickens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> whose favourite dinner-dish would appear to have
    been a fowl, stuffed or otherwise, roast or boiled.</p>
<p>In <i>Oliver Twist</i> we get casual mention of
    oysters, sheep&rsquo;s heads, and a rabbit pie, with
    plenty of alcohol; but the bill of fare, on the
    whole, is not an appetising one. The meat and
    drink at the Maypole Hotel, in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>,
    would appear to have been deservedly popular;
    and the description of Gabriel Varden&rsquo;s breakfast
    is calculated to bring water to the most callous
    mouth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over and above the ordinary tea equipage
    the board creaked beneath the weight of a jolly
    round of beef, a ham of the first magnitude, and
    sundry towers of buttered Yorkshire cake, piled
    slice upon slice in most alluring order. There
    was also a goodly jug of well-browned clay,
    fashioned into the form of an old gentleman not
    by any means unlike the locksmith, atop of whose
    bald head was a fine white froth answering to his
    wig, indicative, beyond dispute, of sparkling home
    brewed ale. But better than fair home-brewed,
    or Yorkshire cake, or ham, or beef, or anything to
    eat or drink that earth or air or water can supply,
    there sat, presiding over all, the locksmith&rsquo;s rosy
    daughter, before whose dark eyes even beef grew
    insignificant, and malt became as nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah-h-h!</p>
<p>There is not much eating in <i>A Tale of Two
    Cities</i>; but an intolerable amount of assorted
    &ldquo;sack.&rdquo; In <i>Sketches by Boz</i> we learn that
    Dickens had no great opinion of public dinners,
    and that oysters were, at that period, occasionally
    opened by the fair sex. There is a nice flavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> of fowl and old Madeira about <i>Dombey and Son</i>,
    and the description of the dinner at Doctor
    Blimber&rsquo;s establishment for young gentlemen is
    worth requoting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some nice soup; also roast meat,
    boiled meat, vegetables, pie, and cheese.&rdquo; [<i>Cheese</i> at a small boys&rsquo; school!] &ldquo;Every young gentleman
    had a massive silver fork and a napkin; and
    all the arrangements were stately and handsome.
    In particular there was a butler in a blue coat and
    bright buttons&rdquo; [surely this was a footman?]
    &ldquo;who gave quite a winey flavour to the table
    beer, he poured it out so superbly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner at Mrs. Jellyby&rsquo;s in <i>Bleak House</i> is
    one of the funniest and most delightful incidents
    in the book, especially the attendance. &ldquo;The
    young woman with the flannel bandage waited,
    and dropped everything on the table wherever it
    happened to go, and never moved it again until
    she put it on the stairs. The person I had seen
    in pattens (who I suppose to have been the cook)
    frequently came and skirmished with her at the
    door, and there appeared to be ill-will between
    them.&rdquo; The dinner given by Mr. Guppy at
    the &ldquo;Slap Bang&rdquo; dining house is another feature
    of this book&mdash;veal and ham, and French beans,
    summer cabbage, pots of half-and-half, marrow
    puddings, &ldquo;three Cheshires&rdquo; and &ldquo;three small
    rums.&rdquo; Of the items in this list, the marrow
    pudding seems to be as extinct&mdash;in London, at all
    events&mdash;as the dodo. It appears to be a mixture
    of bread, pounded almonds, cream, eggs, lemon
    peel, sugar, nutmeg, and marrow; and sounds
    nice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>
<p>David Copperfield&rsquo;s dinner in his Buckingham
    Street chambers was an event with a
    disastrous termination. &ldquo;It was a remarkable
    want of forethought on the part of the ironmonger
    who had made Mrs. Crupp&rsquo;s kitchen fireplace,
    that it was capable of cooking nothing but chops
    and mashed potatoes. As to a fish-kettle, Mrs.
    Crupp said &lsquo;Well! would I only come and look
    at the range? She couldn&rsquo;t say fairer than that.
    Would I come and look at it?&rsquo; As I should not
    have been much the wiser if I <i>had</i> looked at it
    I said never mind fish. But Mrs. Crupp said,
    &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that; oysters was in, and why not
    them?&rsquo; So <i>that</i> was settled. Mrs. Crupp then
    said &lsquo;What she would recommend would be this.
    A pair of hot roast fowls&mdash;from the pastry cook&rsquo;s;
    a dish of stewed beef, with vegetables&mdash;from the
    pastry cook&rsquo;s; two little corner things, as a raised
    pie and a dish of kidneys&mdash;from the pastry cook&rsquo;s;
    a tart, and (if I liked) a shape of jelly&mdash;from the
    pastry cook&rsquo;s. This,&rsquo; Mrs. Crupp said, &lsquo;would
    leave her at full liberty to concentrate her mind
    on the potatoes, and to serve up the cheese and
    celery as she could wish to see it done.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then blessings on thee, Micawber, most
    charming of characters in fiction, mightiest of
    punch-brewers! The only fault I have to find
    with the novel of <i>David Copperfield</i> is that we
    don&rsquo;t get enough of Micawber. The same
    fault, however, could hardly be said to lie in the
    play; for if ever there was a &ldquo;fat&rdquo; part, it is
    Wilkins Micawber.</p>
<p><i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> bubbles over with eating
    and drinking; and &ldquo;Todgers&rdquo; has become as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> proverbial as Hamlet. In <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, too,
    we find plenty of mention of solids and liquids;
    and as a poor stroller myself at one time, it
    has always struck me that &ldquo;business&rdquo; could not
    have been so very bad, after all, in the Crummles
    Combination; for the manager, at all events,
    seems to have fared particularly well. Last on
    the list comes <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>, with the
    celebrated stew at the &ldquo;Jolly Sandboys,&rdquo; the
    ingredients in which have already been quoted by
    the present writer. With regard to this stew
    all that I have to remark is that I should have
    substituted an ox-kidney for the tripe, and left
    out the &ldquo;sparrowgrass,&rdquo; the flavour of which
    would be quite lost in the crowd of ingredients.
    But there! who can cavil at such a feast?
    &ldquo;Fetch me a pint of warm ale, and don&rsquo;t let
    nobody bring into the room even so much as a
    biscuit till the time arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Codlin may not have been &ldquo;the friend&rdquo;; but he
    was certainly the judge of the &ldquo;Punch&rdquo; party.</p>
<p>In this realistic age, meals on the stage have to
    be provided from high-class hotels or restaurants;
    and this is, probably, the chief reason why there
    is so little eating and drinking introduced into
    the modern drama. Gone are the nights of
    the banquet of pasteboard poultry, &ldquo;property&rdquo;
    pine-apples, and gilded flagons containing nothing
    more sustaining than the atmosphere of coal-gas.
    Not much faith is placed in the comic scenes of
    a pantomime nowadays; or it is probable that
    the clown would purloin real York hams, and
    stuff Wall&rsquo;s sausages into the pockets of his
    ample pants. Champagne is champagne under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> the present regime of raised prices, raised salaries,
    raised everything; and it is not so long since I
    overheard an actor-manager chide a waiter from
    a fashionable restaurant, for forgetting the <i>Soubise</i> sauce, when he brought the cutlets.</p>
<p>In my acting days we usually had canvas
    fowls, stuffed with sawdust, when we revelled
    on the stage; or, if business had been particularly
    good, the poultry was made from breakfast rolls,
    with pieces skewered on, to represent the limbs.
    And the potables&mdash;Gadzooks! What horrible
    concoctions have found their way down this
    unsuspecting throttle! Sherry was invariably represented
    by cold tea, which is palatable enough
    if home-made, under careful superintendence,
    but, drawn in the property-master&rsquo;s den, usually
    tasted of glue. Ginger beer, at three-farthings
    for two bottles, poured into tumblers containing
    portions of a seidlitz-powder, always did duty
    for champagne; and as for port or claret&mdash;well,
    I quite thought I had swallowed the deadliest of
    poisons one night, until assured it was only the
    cold leavings of the stage-door-keeper&rsquo;s coffee!</p>
<p>The story of Tiny Tim who ate the goose
    is a pretty familiar one in stage circles. When
    playing Bob Cratchit, in <i>The Christmas Carol</i> at
    the Adelphi, under Mr. Benjamin Webster&rsquo;s
    management, Mr. J. L. Toole had to carve a real
    goose and a &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; plum-pudding during
    the run of that piece, forty nights. And the
    little girl who played Tiny Tim used to finish
    her portions of goose and pudding with such
    amazing celerity that Mr. Toole became quite
    alarmed on her account.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rsquo; I said,&rdquo; writes dear friend
    &ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; in his <i>Reminiscences</i>; &ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
    conceive where a poor, delicate little thing like
    that puts the food. Besides, although I like the
    children to enjoy a treat&rsquo;&mdash;and how they kept
    on enjoying it for forty nights was a mystery,
    for I got into such a condition that if I dined
    at a friend&rsquo;s house, and goose was on the table,
    I regarded it as a personal affront&mdash;I said, referring
    to Tiny Tim, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like greediness;
    and it is additionally repulsive in a refined-looking,
    delicate little thing like this; besides,
    it destroys the sentiment of the situation&mdash;and
    when I, as Bob, ought to feel most pathetic, I
    am always wondering where the goose and the
    pudding are, or whether anything serious in the
    way of a fit will happen to Tiny Tim before
    the audience, in consequence of her unnatural
    gorging!&rsquo; Mrs. Mellon laughed at me at first,
    but eventually we decided to watch Tiny Tim
    together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We watched as well as we could, and the
    moment Tiny Tim was seated, and began to
    eat, we observed a curious shuffling movement
    at the stage-fireplace, and everything that I had
    given her, goose and potatoes, and apple-sauce
    disappeared behind the sham stove, the child
    pretending to eat as heartily as ever from the
    empty plate. When the performance was over,
    Mrs. Mellon and myself asked the little girl
    what became of the food she did not eat, and,
    after a little hesitation, she confessed that her
    little sister (I should mention that they were
    the children of one of the scene-shifters) waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> on the other side of the fireplace for the supplies,
    and then the whole family enjoyed a hearty
    supper every night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dickens was very much interested in the
    incident. When I had finished, he smiled a
    little sadly, I thought, and then, shaking me by
    the hand, he said, &lsquo;Ah! you ought to have given
    her the whole goose.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>William of Normandy&mdash;A &ldquo;head&rdquo; wind at sea&mdash;Beware the
        druggist&mdash;Pick-me-ups of all sorts and conditions&mdash;Anchovy
        toast for the invalid&mdash;A small bottle&mdash;Straight talks to

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; observed William of Normandy
    to his quartermaster-general, on the morning
    after the revelry which followed the Battle of
    Hastings, &ldquo;who makes these barbarians&rsquo; wines;
    send me the man who can remove the beehive
    from my o&rsquo;erwrought brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark is not to be found in Macaulay&rsquo;s <i>History of England</i>; but learned authorities who
    have read the original MS. in Early Norman,
    make no doubt as to the correct translation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is excellent,&rdquo; as the poet says, &ldquo;to have
    a giant&rsquo;s thirst; but it is tyrannous to use it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> like a giant.&rdquo; And not only &ldquo;tyrannous&rdquo; but
    short-sighted. For the law of compensation is
    one of the first edicts of Nature. The same
    beneficent hand which provides the simple fruits
    of the earth for the delectation of man, furnishes
    also the slug and the wasp, to see that he doesn&rsquo;t
    get too much. Our friend the dog is deprived
    of the power of articulation, but he has a tail
    which can be wagged at the speed of 600 revolutions
    to the minute. And the man who overtaxes
    the powers of his inner mechanism during the
    hours of darkness is certain to feel the effects, to
    be smitten of conscience, and troubled of brain,
    when he awakes, a few hours later on. As this
    is not a medical treatise it would be out of place
    to analyse at length the abominable habit which
    the human brain and stomach have acquired, of
    acting and reacting on each other; suffice it to
    say that there is no surer sign of the weakness
    and helplessness of poor, frail, sinful, fallen
    humanity than the obstinacy with which so
    many of us will, for the sake of an hour or two&rsquo;s
    revelry, boldly bid for five times the amount of
    misery and remorse. And this more especially
    applies to a life on the ocean wave. The
    midshipmite who over-estimates his swallowing
    capacity is no longer &ldquo;mast-headed&rdquo; next
    morning; but the writer has experienced a
    cyclone in the Bay of Bengal, ere the effects of
    a birthday party on the previous night had been
    surmounted; and the effects of &ldquo;mast-heading&rdquo;
    could hardly have been less desirable. In that
    most delightful work for the young, Dana&rsquo;s <i>Two
    years before the Mast</i>, we read:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our forecastle, as usual after a liberty-day, was
    a scene of tumult all night long, from the drunken
    ones. They had just got to sleep toward morning,
    when they were turned up with the rest,
    and kept at work all day in the water, carrying
    hides, their heads aching so that they could
    hardly stand. This is sailors&rsquo; pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dana himself was ordered up aloft, to reef
    &ldquo;torpsles,&rdquo; on his first morning at sea; and he
    had probably had some sort of a farewell carouse,
    &rsquo;ere quitting Boston. And the present writer
    upon one occasion&mdash;such is the irony of fate&mdash;was
    told off to indite a leading article on &ldquo;Temperance&rdquo;
    for an evening journal, within a very few
    hours of the termination of a &ldquo;Derby&rdquo; banquet.</p>
<p>But how shall we alleviate the pangs? How
    make that dreadful &ldquo;day after&rdquo; endurable enough
    to cause us to offer up thanks for being still allowed
    to live? Come, the panacea, good doctor!</p>
<p>First of all, then, avoid the chemist and his
    works. I mean no disrespect to my good friend
    Sainsbury, or his &ldquo;Number One Pick-me-up,&rdquo;
    whose corpse-reviving claims are indisputable;
    but at the same time the habitual swallower of
    drugs does not lead the happiest life. I once
    knew a young subaltern who had an account
    presented to him by the cashier of the firm of
    Peake and Allen, of the great continent of India,
    for nearly 300 rupees; and the items in said account
    were entirely chloric ether, extract of cardamoms&mdash;with
    the other component parts of a high-class
    restorative, and interest. Saddening! The next
    thing to avoid, the first thing in the morning,
    is soda-water, whether diluted with brandy or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> whisky. The &ldquo;peg&rdquo; may be all very well as
    an occasional potation, but, believe one who has
    tried most compounds, &rsquo;tis a precious poor
    &ldquo;livener.&rdquo; On the contrary, although a beaker
    of the straw-coloured (or occasionally, mahogany-coloured)
    fluid may seem to steady the nerves for
    the time being, that effect is by no means lasting.</p>
<p>But the same panacea will not do in every
    case. If the patient be sufficiently convalescent
    to digest a</p>
<h4><i>Doctor</i></h4>
<p>(I do <i>not</i> mean a M.R.C.S.) his state must be far
    from hopeless. A &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; is a mixture of
    beaten raw egg&mdash;not forgetting the white, which
    is of even more value than the yolk to the
    invalid&mdash;brandy, a little sifted sugar, and new
    milk. But many devotees of Bacchus could as
    soon swallow rum-and-oysters, in bed. And do
    not let us blame Bacchus unduly for the matutinal
    trouble. The fairy <i>Ala</i> has probably had a
    lot to do with that trouble. A &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; can
    be made with sherry or whisky, instead of brandy;
    and many stockbrokers&rsquo; clerks, sporting journalists,
    and other millionaires prefer a</p>
<h4><i>Surgeon-Major</i>,</h4>
<p>who appears in the form of a large tumbler containing
    a couple of eggs beaten, and filled to the
    brim with the wine of the champagne district.</p>
<h4><i>A Scorcher</i></h4>
<p>is made with the juice of half a lemon squeezed
    into a large wine-glass; add a liqueur-glassful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> old brandy, or Hollands, and a dust of cayenne.
    Mix well, and do not allow any lemon-pips to
    remain in the glass.</p>
<h4><i>Prairie Oyster.</i></h4>
<p>This is an American importation. There is
    a legend to the effect that one of a hunting party
    fell sick unto death, on the boundless prairie of
    Texas, and clamoured for oysters. Now the
    close and cautious bivalve no more thrives in a
    blue grass country than he possesses the ability
    to walk up stairs, or make a starting-price book.
    So one of the party, an inventive genius, cudgelled
    his brains for a substitute. He found some
    prairie hen&rsquo;s eggs, and administered the unbroken
    yolks thereof, one at a time, in a wine-glass containing
    a teaspoonful of vinegar. He shook the
    pepper-castor over the yolks and added a pinch
    of salt. The patient recovered. The march of
    science has improved on this recipe. Instead of
    despoiling the prairie hen, the epicure now looks
    to Madame Gobble for a turkey egg. And a</p>
<h4><i>Worcester Oyster</i></h4>
<p>is turned out ready made, by simply substituting
    a teaspoonful of Lea and Perrins&rsquo; most excellent
    sauce for vinegar.</p>
<h4><i>Brazil Relish.</i></h4>
<p>This is, I am assured, a much-admired restorative
    in Brazil, and the regions bordering on the River
    Plate. It does not sound exactly the sort of
    stimulant to take after a &ldquo;bump supper,&rdquo; or a
    &ldquo;Kaffir&rdquo; entertainment, but here it is: Into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> wine-glass half full of curaçoa pop the unbroken
    yolk of a bantam&rsquo;s egg. Fill the glass up with
    maraschino. According to my notion, a good
    cup of hot, strong tea would be equally effectual,
    as an emetic, and withal cheaper. But they
    certainly take the mixture as a pick-me-up in
    Brazil.</p>
<h4><i>Port-flip</i></h4>
<p>is a favourite stimulant with our American
    cousins. Beat up an egg in a tumbler&mdash;if you
    have no metal vessels to shake it in, the shortest
    way is to put a clean white card, or a saucer, over
    the mouth of the tumbler, and shake&mdash;then add
    a little sugar, a glass of port, and some pounded
    ice. Strain before drinking. Leaving out the
    ice and the straining, this is exactly the same
    &ldquo;refresher&rdquo; which the friends of a criminal, who
    had served his term of incarceration in one of
    H.M. gaols, were in the habit of providing for
    him; and when the Cold Bath Fields Prison was
    a going concern, there was a small hostelry hard
    by, in which, on a Monday morning, the consumption
    of port wine (fruity) and eggs (&ldquo;shop
    &rsquo;uns,&rdquo; every one) was considerable. This on the
    word of an ex-warder, who subsequently became
    a stage-door keeper.</p>
<p>One of the most unsatisfactory effects of good
    living is that the demon invoked over-night does
    not always assume the same shape in your
    waking hours. Many sufferers will feel a loathing
    for any sort of food or drink, except cold
    water. &ldquo;The capting,&rdquo; observed the soldier-servant
    to a visitor (this is an old story), &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> very well this morning, sir; he&rsquo;ve just drunk his
    bath, and gone to bed again.&rdquo; And on the other
    hand, I have known the over-indulger absolutely
    ravenous for his breakfast. &ldquo;Brandy and soda,
    no, dear old chappie; as many eggs as they can
    poach in five minutes, a thick rasher of York
    ham, two muffins, and about a gallon and a half
    of hot coffee&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I feel like.&rdquo; Medical
    men will be able to explain those symptoms in the
    roysterer, who had probably eaten and drunk
    quite as much over-night as the &ldquo;capting.&rdquo; For
    the roysterer with a shy appetite there are few
    things more valuable than an</p>
<h4><i>Anchovy Toast</i>.</h4>
<p>The concoction of this belongs to bedroom
    cookery, unless the sitting-room adjoins the sleeping
    apartment. For the patient will probably be
    too faint of heart to wish to meet his fellow-men
    and women downstairs, so early. The mixture
    must be made <i>over hot water</i>. Nearly fill a slop-basin
    with the boiling element, and place a soup-plate
    over it. In the plate melt a pat of butter
    the size of a walnut. Then having beaten up a
    raw egg, stir it in. When thoroughly incorporated
    with the butter add a dessert-spoonful of
    essence of anchovies. Cayenne <i>ad lib</i>. Then
    let delicately-browned crisp toast be brought, hot
    from the fire. Soak this in the mixture, and
    eat as quickly as you can. The above proportions
    must be increased if more than one patient
    clamours for anchovy toast; and this recipe is of
    no use for a dinner, or luncheon toast; remember
    that. After the meal is finished turn in between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> the sheets again for an hour; then order a
    &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Surgeon-Major&rdquo; to be brought
    to the bedside. In another twenty minutes the
    patient will be ready for his tub (with the chill
    off, if he be past thirty, and has any wisdom, or
    liver, left within him). After dressing, if he live
    in London and there be any trace of brain-rack
    remaining, let him take a brisk walk to his hair-dresser&rsquo;s,
    having his boots cleaned <i>en route</i>. This
    is most important, whether they be clean or dirty;
    for the action of a pair of briskly-directed brushes
    over the feet will often remove the most distressing
    of headaches. Arrived at the perruquier&rsquo;s, let
    the patient direct him to rub <i>eau de Cologne</i>, or
    some other perfumed spirit, into the o&rsquo;er-taxed
    cranium, and to squirt assorted essences over the
    distorted countenance. A good hard brush, and
    a dab of bay rum on the temples will complete
    the cure; the roysterer will then be ready to face
    his employer, or the maiden aunt from whom he
    may have expectations.</p>
<p>If the flavour of the anchovy be disagreeable,
    let the patient try the following toast, which is
    similar to that used with wildfowl: Melt a pat
    of butter over hot water, stir in a dessert-spoonful
    of Worcester sauce, the same quantity of orange
    juice, a pinch of cayenne, and about half a wine-glassful
    of old port. Soak the toast in this mixture.
    The virtues of old port as a restorative cannot be
    too widely known.</p>
<h4><i>St. Mark&rsquo;s Pick-me-up.</i></h4>
<p>The following recipe was given to the writer
    by a member of an old Venetian family.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p>Ten drops of Angostura in a liqueur-glass,
    filled up with orange bitters. One wine-glassful
    of old brandy, one ditto cold water, one liqueur-glassful
    of curaçoa, and the juice of half a lemon.
    Mix well together. I have not yet tried this,
    which reads rather acid.</p>
<p>For an</p>
<h4><i>Overtrained</i></h4>
<p>athlete, who may not take kindly to his rations,
    there is no better cure than the lean of an underdone
    chop (<i>not blue</i> inside) hot from the fire, on a
    hot plate, with a glass of port poured over. A</p>
<h4><i>Hot-pickle Sandwich</i></h4>
<p>should be made of two thin slices of crisp toast
    (no butter) with chopped West Indian pickles in
    between. And for a</p>
<h4><i>Devilled Biscuit</i></h4>
<p>select the plain cheese biscuit, heat in the oven,
    and then spread over it a paste composed of finely-pounded
    lobster worked up with butter, made
    mustard, ground ginger, cayenne, salt, chili
    vinegar, and (if liked) a little curry powder.
    Reheat the biscuit for a minute or two, and
    then deal with it. Both the last-named restoratives
    will be found valuable (?) liver tonics; and
    to save future worry the patient had better
    calculate, at the same time, the amount of Estate
    Duty which will have to be paid out of his
    personalty, and secure a nice dry corner, out of
    the draught, for his place of sepulture. A</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Working-Man&rsquo;s Livener</i>,</h4>
<p>(and by &ldquo;working-man&rdquo; the gentleman whose
    work consists principally in debating in taverns is
    intended) is usually a hair of the dog that bit
    him over-night; and in some instances where
    doubt may exist as to the particular &ldquo;tufter&rdquo; of
    the pack which found the working-man out,
    the livener will be a miscellaneous one. For
    solid food, this brand of labourer will usually
    select an uncooked red-herring, which he will
    divide into swallow-portions with his clasp-knife,
    after borrowing the pepper-castor from the tavern
    counter. And as new rum mixed with four-penny
    ale occasionally enters into the over-night&rsquo;s
    programme of the horny-handed one, he is
    frequently very thirsty indeed before the hour of
    noon.</p>
<p>I have seen a journalist suck half a lemon,
    previously well besprinkled with cayenne, prior to
    commencing his matutinal &ldquo;scratch.&rdquo; But rum
    and milk form, I believe, the favourite livener
    throughout the district which lies between the
    Adelphi Theatre and St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. And,
    according to Doctor Edward Smith (the chief
    English authority on dietetics), rum and milk
    form the most powerful restorative known to
    science. With all due respect to Doctor Smith
    I am prepared to back another restorative, commonly
    known as &ldquo;a small bottle&rdquo;; which means
    a pint of champagne. I have prescribed this
    many a time, and seldom known it fail. In case
    of partial failure repeat the dose. A valuable if
    seldom-employed restorative is made with</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Bovril</i></h4>
<p>as one of the ingredients. Make half-a-pint of
    beef-tea in a tumbler with this extract. Put the
    tumbler in a refrigerator for an hour, then add a
    liqueur-glassful of old brandy, with just a dust of
    cayenne. This is one of the very best pick-me-ups
    known to the faculty. A</p>
<h4><i>Swizzle</i>,</h4>
<p>for recuperative purposes is made with the following
    ingredients:&mdash;a wine-glassful of Hollands, a
    liqueur-glassful of curaçoa, three drops of Angostura
    bitters, a little sugar, and half a small bottle
    of seltzer-water. Churn up the mixture with a
    swizzle-stick, which can be easily made with the
    assistance of a short length of cane (the ordinary
    school-treat brand) a piece of cork, a bit of string,
    and a pocket knife.</p>
<p>A very extraordinary pick-me-up is mentioned
    by Mr. F. C. Philips, in one of his novels, and
    consists of equal parts of brandy and chili vinegar
    in a large wine-glass. Such a mixture would, in
    all probability, corrode sheet-iron. I am afraid
    that writers of romance occasionally borrow a
    little from imagination.</p>
<p>The most effectual restorative for the total
    abstainer is unquestionably, old brandy. It
    should be remembered that a rich, heavy dinner
    is not bound to digest within the human frame,
    if washed down with tea, or aerated beverages.
    In fact, from the personal appearances of many
    worthy teetotallers I have known digestion cannot
    be their strong suit. Then many abstainers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> only abstain in public, for the sake of example.
    And within the locked cupboard of the study
    lurks a certain black bottle, which does <i>not</i> contain Kopps&rsquo;s ale. Therefore I repeat that
    the most effectual restorative for the total abstainer&mdash;whether
    as a direct change, or as a hair of the
    dog&mdash;is brandy.</p>
<p>Our ancestors cooled their coppers with small
    ale, and enjoyed a subsequent sluice at the pump in
    the yard; these methods are still pursued by stable-helpers
    and such like. A good walk acts beneficially
    sometimes. Eat or drink nothing at all,
    but try and do five miles along the turnpike road
    within the hour. Many habitual roysterers hunt
    the next morning, with heads opening and shutting
    alternately, until the fox breaks covert, when
    misery of all sorts at once takes to itself wings.
    And I have heard a gallant warrior, whilst engaged
    in a Polo match on York Knavesmire, protest that
    he could distinctly see <i>two</i> Polo balls. But he
    was not in such bad case as the eminent jockey
    who declined to ride a horse in a hood and
    blinkers, because &ldquo;one of us must see, and I&rsquo;m
    hanged if <i>I</i> can!&rdquo; It was the same jockey who,
    upon being remonstrated with for taking up his
    whip at the final bend, when his horse was
    winning easily, replied: &ldquo;whip be blowed! it
    was my balance pole: I should have fell off without
    it!&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>Straight Talks.</i></h4>
<p>In the lowest depth there is a lower depth,
    which not only threatens to devour, but which
    will infallibly devour the too-persistent roysterer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> For such I labour not. The seer of visions, the
    would-be strangler of serpents, the baffled rat-hunter,
    and other victims to the over-estimation
    of human capacity will get no assistance, beyond
    infinite pity, from the mind which guides this
    pen. The dog will return to his own vomit; the
    wilful abuser of the goods sent by a bountiful
    Providence is past praying for. But to others
    who are on the point of crossing the Rubicon of
    good discretion I would urge that there will
    assuredly come a time when the pick-me-up
    will lose its virtue, and will fail to chase the
    sorrow from the brow, to minister to the diseased
    mind. Throughout this book I have
    endeavoured to preach the doctrine of moderation
    in enjoyment. Meat and drink are, like fire,
    very good servants, but the most oppressive and
    exacting of slave-drivers. Therefore enjoy the
    sweets of life, whilst ye can; but as civilised
    beings, as gentlemen, and not as swine. For
    here is a motto which applies to eating and
    drinking even more than to other privileges
    which we enjoy:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="stanza"> <span style="margin-left:-4em">&ldquo;Wisely, and slow;<br />
        </span> <span class="i1">They stumble who run fast!&rdquo;<br />
        </span> </div>
</div>
<p>A resort to extremes is always to be deprecated,
    and many sensible men hold the total abstainer
    in contempt, unless he abstain simply and solely
    because a moderate use of &ldquo;beer and baccy&rdquo;
    makes him ill; and this man is indeed a rarity.
    The teetotaller is either a creature with no will-power
    in his composition, a Pharisee, who thanks
    Providence that he is not as other men, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> lunatic. There can be no special virtue in
    &ldquo;swearing off&rdquo; good food and good liquor;
    whether for the sake of example, or for the sake
    of ascending a special pinnacle and posing to
    the world as the incarnation of perfection and
    holiness. In the parable, the Publican was
    &ldquo;justified&rdquo; rather than the Pharisee, because the
    former had the more common sense, and knew
    that if he set up as immaculate and without
    guile he was deceiving himself and nobody else.
    But here on earth, in the nineteenth century,
    the Publican stands a very poor chance with the
    Pharisee, whether the last-named assume the
    garb of &ldquo;Social Purity,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Vigilance,&rdquo; or the
    sombre raiment of the policeman. This is not
    right. This is altogether wrong. The total
    abstainer, the rabid jackass who denies himself&mdash;or
    claims that he does so&mdash;the juice of the grape,
    and drinks the horrible, flatulent, concoctions
    known as &ldquo;temperance beverages,&rdquo; is just as
    great a sinner against common sense as that
    rabid jackass the habitual glutton, or drunkard,
    who, in abusing the good things of life&mdash;the
    gifts which are given us to enjoy&mdash;is putting
    together a rod of rattlesnakes for his own back.</p>
<p>There is nothing picturesque about drunkenness;
    and there is still less of manliness therein.
    There is plenty of excuse for the careless, happy-go-lucky,
    casual over-estimater, who revels, on
    festive occasions, with his boon companions.
    &rsquo;Tis a poor heart that never rejoices; and
    wedding-feasts, celebrations of famous victories,
    birthday parties, and Christmas festivities have
    been, and will continue to be, held by high and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> low, from the earliest times. But there is no
    excuse, but only pity and disgust, for the sot
    who sits and soaks&mdash;or, worse still, stands and
    soaks&mdash;in the tavern day after day, and carries
    the brandy-bottle to bed with him. I have lived
    through two-thirds of the years allotted to man,
    and have never yet met the man who has done
    himself, or anybody else, any good by eating or
    drinking to excess. Nor is the man who has
    benefited himself, or society, through scorning
    and vilifying good cheer, a familiar sight in our
    midst. &ldquo;Keep in the middle of the road,&rdquo; is
    the rule to be observed; and there is no earthly
    reason why the man who may have applied &ldquo;hot
    and rebellious liquors&rdquo; to his blood, as a youth,
    should not enjoy that &ldquo;lusty winter&rdquo; of old age,
    &ldquo;frosty but kindly,&rdquo; provided those warm and
    warlike liquors have been applied in moderation.</p>
<p>I will conclude this sermon with part of a
    verse of the poet Dryden&rsquo;s imitation of the
    twenty-ninth Ode of Horace, though its heathen <i>carpe diem</i> sentiments should be qualified by a
    special caution as to the possible ill effects of
    bidding too fierce a defiance to the &ldquo;reaction
    day.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
